<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We propose a three-year research program to estimate the basin-scale carbon balance of
Amazônia, using a combination of data collected by flux towers, light rental aircraft,
and remote sensing, and geographic information systems, interpreted and integrated with
numerical modeling of ecosystem carbon flux and regional atmospheric. Tower flux data from
sites in intact forest, re-growing forest, pasture, and savanna, will be used to calibrate
a model of ecosystem physiology and biogeochemistry (based on the component models SiB2
and CASA) for each major cover type in the region. This model will be coupled to a
mesoscale atmospheric model (RAMS), to investigate the propagation of the
&quot;signal&quot; of terrestrial carbon flux into the local and regional atmosphere.
Light aircraft will be used to estimate regional convective boundary-layer budgets of CO2
and its stable isotopes, and these data will be used in conjunction with the model to
estimate carbon budgets of each cover type over much larger areas than is possible from
the towers. The improved ecosystem model will then be applied across the basin using
remotely sensed data and a GIS, to calculate the spatial structure of ecosystem carbon
flux throughout the year. These estimated fluxes will be used in the mesoscale atmospheric
model to predict 4-dimensional fields of CO2 and d13C, which can be
compared to data collected by later aircraft campaigns such as LBA-CLAIRE or TRACE-B, when
they become available. It is hoped that our results will allow reliable carbon budget
estimation in other regions from EOS data in the future using relatively inexpensive
aircraft sampling programs. </p>

<p>Preferred Sites</p>

<p>We will necessarily work with whatever sites are chosen for eddy covariance flux
towers. We prefer to work with flux tower sites in (1) intact forest; (2) re-growing
forest, (3) savanna, and (4) pasture. The CBL budget work is designed to work with a
&quot;lake-breeze&quot; circulation in the vicinity of a large body of water, and would
add significant value to the flask air sampling program proposed by Tans, Bakwin, and
Artaxo, if it were located between their sampling sites (Belém and Manaus). We have
identified the area around Santarém, Pará as a likely site that meets most of these
criteria. </p>

<p>Activities</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>1998: Develop and test the coupled SiB2-CASA carbon model. Couple this to RAMS.</li>
      <li>1998-1999: Perform site calibration of SiB2-CASA model using ABRACOS data,
        available LBA eddy covariance data, and site meteorology for sites in intact forest,
        regenerating forest, savanna, and pasture.</li>
      <li>1999: Perform LES simulations of PBL structure, CO2, and d13C
        at tower flux sites. Perform mesoscale &quot;lake-breeze&quot; simulations of internal
        boundary layer development and use the results to plan aircraft campaign.</li>
      <li>1999: Conduct aircraft campaign (using rental aircraft) to measure CBL budgets of
        CO2 and d13C over regional area surrounding one or more flux tower
        sites.</li>
      <li>1999-2000: Obtain basin-scale data products on land cover classification,
        eco-physiological, and phenology parameters derived from remotely sensed data or provided
        from other LBA investigators. Use these to parameterize SiB2 across
        Amazônia.</li>
      <li>2000: Perform basin-scale simulations of ecosystem carbon and d13C flux in
        coupled SiB2-RAMS model, forced with 4-D data assimilation products and nested down to
        local scale in the vicinity of each LBA flux site. Analyze spatial and temporal patterns,
        rectifier effect, and produce sensitivity analysis for later aircraft campaigns (e.g.,
        LBA-CLAIRE).</li>
    </ul>
