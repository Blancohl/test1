<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We propose studies in carbon storage and exchange. We propose to work in disturbed and
undisturbed sites along a C3/C4 gradient (savanna to rainforest). </p>

<p>Project Overview</p>

<p>We propose to measure stable isotope ratio measurements of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
to infer changes in terrestrial ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration (sink or source
strength) on local and regional scales. These measurements will be made in conjunction
with soil respiration rates and collaborative studies with eddy flux tower studies. Within
terrestrial ecosystems, photosynthesis and respiration have different and contrasting
effects on the carbon and oxygen isotope ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Monitoring
shifts in both the concentration and stable isotope ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
can be used as a tool to study large scale terrestrial ecosystem gas exchange processes,
but the linkages of ecosystem and regional isotope ratio signals have not been attempted
in the past. Regional and global interpretation of the stable isotope signal recorded by
the atmosphere requires an understanding of fractionation processes that occur during
ecosystem gas exchange processes. While we have gained a mechanistic understanding of
leaf-level isotope effects during photosynthesis and respiration, we need to extend and
apply our knowledge of isotope effects to the ecosystem- and regional-level in order to
constrain models so that calculations of large scale ecosystem gas exchange processes can
be made with confidence.</p>

<p>We have developed a nested sampling scheme for measuring isotope effects associated
with photosynthesis and respiration at three spatial scales: (i) individual chamber at the
soil surface; (ii) canopy tower for canopy and/or ecosystem level; (iii) aircraft sampling
of changes in the convective boundary layer for the regional level. Our research plan will
allow us to determine the impacts of land-use changes (conversion of C3 forest to C4
pasture grasses) to regional productivity because the C3 and C4 plants have very different
isotope effects during photosynthesis. Interannual variability associated with El Niño/
La Niña events should also have substantial effects on the timing and magnitude of
ecosystem gas exchange processes and associated isotope effects. Direct measurements of
the effects of El Niño/ La Niña events on isotope effects during photosynthesis and
respiration are needed for future large scale isotope modeling studies. </p>

<p>Proposed Measurements</p>

<p>The proposed study will make several key LBA-ECO measurements at each of the three
primary regions along the east Amazônia transect between Brasília and Manaus, including:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>soil respiration rates</li>
      <li>carbon isotope ratio analyses of soil organic matter</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratio analyses of leaf material</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of CO<sub>2</sub> within the soil</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of CO<sub>2</sub> released from the soil surface</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of total ecosystem respiration</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of ecosystem photosynthetic discrimination</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of landscape-level respiration</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of landscape-level photosynthetic discrimination</li>
      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios and profiles of CO<sub>2</sub> within the convective
        boundary layer</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The measurements are proposed to be collected 2-4 times per year, depending on
parameter complexity and other team-project considerations. Our studies will be conducted
in close association with simultaneous eddy covariance measurements, made by other
researchers, in order to obtain information about ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration
and turbulent exchange. The leaf- level, canopy- level, and regional-level models of
isotope fractionation can be used to determine the effect of different terrestrial
ecosystems on the carbon and oxygen isotope ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, because
of differences in photosynthetic pathway, ecosystem composition, and environmental
influences. The information gathered using our isotope studies would help in determining
the role of the Amazon Basin as a net sink or source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. </p>

<p>Preferred Sites</p>

<p>Our interest is in spanning from seasonally dry cerrado ecosystems (Brasília) to
seasonal rain forests (Pará) and through aseasonal rainforest ecosystems (Manaus).
Primary research sites in each of three major areas along this geographic transect will be
chosen in (a) primary rainforest or cerrado, (b) pastures derived from primary forest
conversion, and (c) secondary growth forest. This provides us with 9 different sites with
which to examine ecosystem and land-use changes (canopy and soil levels) and with 3
regions across Amazônia with which to examine landscape processes. Strong isotope ratio
gradients exist at each of the major sites that should allow us to differentiate carbon
turnover and respiration sources. Clear C3/C4 differences in species composition exist
between forest and pasture species along this entire gradient. Virtually all of the
pasture species (native and introduced) have C4 photosynthesis and all of the forest
species have C3 photosynthesis. A potentially strong C3 - C4 gradient exists as well in
the transition between tropical rainforest and cerrado ecosystems. </p>

<p>Education</p>

<p>This proposal provides a strong education component, which includes training Brazilian
graduate and postgraduate scientists. We plan to provide lecture/laboratory opportunities
for Brazilians to participate in the Utah Stable Isotope Ecology course, as well as
exploring development of a similar course in Brazil. There is also the opportunity for
other LBA investigators to receive stable isotope ratio training at SIRFER. </p>
