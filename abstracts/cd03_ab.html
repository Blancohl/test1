<p ALIGN="left">Periodic, transient, and spatially inhomogeneous influences on C
exchange in Amazonia</p>

<b>David R. Fitzjarrald</b> -- Atmospheric Sciences Research Center University at Albany,

<p>Motivation</p>

<p>We propose observations and analyses to infer transports of CO<sub>2</sub>, water
vapor, and energy from the natural and the disturbed rain forest by making direct and
inferential flux measurements. A major focus is to determine how Amazonian carbon exchange
is affected by natural and human-induced temporal and spatial variability in the
ecosystem. </p>

<p>Objectives</p>

<ol>
  <li>To describe the radiation environment of the upper and lower canopy in natural and
    logged regions, to understand how the intensity and quality of incoming radiation are
    altered by cloudiness, and to determine what is the resulting effect on net ecosystem
    exchange of C (NEE). </li>
  <li>To describe and model the mechanisms of turbulent canopy-atmosphere exchange in regions
    of closed-canopy primary forest, near natural gaps, and in the cut-over mosaic of a
    selectively </li>
  <li>Logged site. </li>
  <li>To relate canopy layer and boundary layer concentrations of potential temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>,
    and H<sub>2</sub>O, and use this information to estimate their partition into surface and
    canopy source components. </li>
  <li>To determine what limits the accuracy of long-term tower flux observations of net
    ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the rain forest. </li>
</ol>

<p>Work Plan -- Detecting the Importance of Inhomogeneities on Observed Carbon Fluxes</p>

<ul>
  <li>To describe the ecosystem light environment, we plan to locate radiation booms on the 60
    m Rohn towers at the primary forest (PF) and selective logged (SL) sites. These booms are
    self-contained units that provide long-wave, short-wave, PAR, and net radiation in each
    vertical direction, and include an electronic level readout. A rotating shadowband
    radiometer in a clearing will measure diffuse and direct radiation components.</li>
  <li>To make estimates of the respiration rate from tower CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
    observations, continuous acoustic wind profiler measurements will be maintained. By
    monitoring the backscatter signal, the thickness of the stable boundary layer will be
    obtained and the nocturnal surface flux (respiration rate) found by the layer budget
    approach.</li>
  <li>To determine the importance of natural and artificial gaps on canopy venting,
    microclimatic studies using turbulence instrumentation and sub-canopy sounding balloons
    will be deployed at several sites during IFCUs. For selected periods, balloons will also
    carry small-diameter tubing that will sample the CO<sub>2</sub> profile in the gap, using
    a battery-operated pump connected to a CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer.</li>
  <li>Sub-canopy flux measurements. The measurements, in conjunction with the profiles of T,
    q, and [CO<sub>2</sub>] proposed by Wofsy and Goulden, offer a unique opportunity to
    measure and then parameterize the mechanisms of mass exchange between the rain forest and
    the lower atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Tower representativeness. We will apply and refine existing techniques to determine the
    source region for surface-based and canopy fluxes, using a vertical profile of turbulence
    intensity appropriate to the undisturbed and logged forest sites, respectively. We propose
    to operate a sonic anemometer at levels just above the canopy with the objective to
    determine at what times this level and tower top may lie in different turbulent
    microclimates.</li>
  <li>To track cloud fraction and cloud base as 30 s intervals, a ceilometer will be deployed.</li>
  <li>To determine cloud type and to make another estimate of cloud fraction, a digital sky
    camera will be operated for selected periods. In analysis we will seek to link these cloud
    characteristics from the surface observations to those from satellite images.</li>
  <li>Two secondary tower sites, to be fitted with automatic weather stations that communicate
    to the PFsite by radio modem, will provide the minimal surface network for use with
    mesoscale modeling. This will also provide the framework to decide if there are systematic
    biases in climate observations from riverside stations.</li>
  <li>Daytime mixed layer thickness will be found using established relationships between
    cloud base and mixing layer thickness, using the sounder and ceilometer data in tandem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Training</p>

<p>We are prepared to give a training course in micrometeorological methods used in
ecological studies, to be held in and around Santarém. Since several of the ASRC team are
fluent in Portuguese, the material in these courses can be presented in that language or
in Spanish. In addition, transfer of the data acquisition system hardware and software to
local teams is planned. </p>

<p>Links to Other Groups</p>

<p>Our efforts link to the continuous flux measurements proposed by Wofsy et al. (Harvard
University) at the undisturbed Tapajós site and similar observations proposed by Goulden.
(University of California, Irvine) at the logged site. The canopy-atmosphere exchange and
nocturnal respiration studies link directly to the 222Rn tracer studies proposed by
Martens (University of North Carolina) and to chamber measurements planned by Keller,
Crill, and Silver and by Goulden. (U.S. Forest Service, University of New Hampshire).
Studies of turbulence in the sub-canopy and roughness layers are done in collaboration
with O. Moraes (Federal University of Santa Maria, RS, Brazil) . The proposed work links
directly with the mesoscale model studies of the river breeze planned by M. Silva Dias
(University of São Paulo, Brazil ). </p>
