<p>Objectives
</p>

<p>Amazônian forests are burning beneath the canopy. Each year, accidental ground fires
burn a forest area that is similar in size to the area that is cleared and burned, with
large but poorly understood impacts on carbon stocks, forest metabolism, forest hydrology
and the prospect of sustainable forest management. But these ground fires are not included
in deforestation estimates. Forest fires have the potential to initiate a positive
feedback with local climate, because fire induced reductions in forest evapotranspiration
may cause declines in local rainfall, provoking additional burning of forests which are,
themselves, more susceptible to fire each time they burn. These fires may be the first
step in a process of &quot;savannization&quot;, in which recurrent burning favors the
replacement of fire-sensitive trees by fire-resistant grasses and thick-barked trees, a
process that has already transformed much of the woodland forests of the Brazilian
Cerrado, adjacent to Amazônia, into grass-dominated savannas.<br>
</p>

<p>In the proposed research, we will contribute to the land-use, carbon stocks and surface
water chemistry themes of the LBA-ECO campaign by investigating forest fire. We will
estimate the contribution of anthropogenic forest fires in Amazônia and the Cerrado to
fluxes of carbon and water, and to the economic value of these forests, through a
combination of field experiments and measurements, landholder surveys, and regional
modeling. The proposed research will provide several data sets for the broader LBA
campaign. We will use eddy correlation towers to measure net ecosystem fluxes of carbon
and water vapor in four Cerrado woodlands with different levels of fire frequency. We will
measure the soil water balance to 8 m depth at these Cerrado sites, in two mature forests
and one logged forest equipped with towers in Amazônia, and in one logged forest that is
experimentally burned. These measurements will allow us to determine the soil layers from
which water is being extracted to supply evapotranspiration and to provide an independent
estimate of evapotranspiration that will permit interpretation and testing of the
tower-based estimates of ET. We will also quantify several components of net primary
productivity that must be measured to interpret tower-based measurements of net ecosystem
productivity, including fine and coarse root biomass (to 8 meters depth), fine and coarse
litterfall, and stemwood increment. Our study will provide land-use history maps for 300
geo-referenced Amazônian properties, stratified by property size and region, including
the timing of forest clearing, forest logging, forest burning, and agricultural management
practices, and the economic costs and benefits of fire prevention and fire control
practices. Finally, we will develop a mechanistic, predictive model that will allow us to
estimate the area of Amazônian forest that burns each year, and associated changes in
carbon stocks and water flux. This model will allow us to begin to examine the impacts of
climate change and land-use policy change on forest fire. Hence, the proposed study has
the potential to contribute directly to the LBA goal of promoting sustainable land-use
practices. </p>
