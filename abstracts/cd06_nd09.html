<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We propose studies in 4 theme areas of LBA Ecology, with a primary emphasis on the
dynamics of surface water chemistry, and secondary emphases on nutrient dynamics, trace
gas fluxes, and carbon. Our research objectives are to: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish the geographic and geochemical sources of C, N, and P species for river
        corridors,</li>
      <li>Define the biogeochemical consequences for water chemistry (and to a lesser extent gas
        emissions) of anthropogenic perturbations against the background of natural environmental
        variability,</li>
      <li>Determine the downstream fate of sediments, nutrients, and organic matter, as mediated
        by the transport properties of the river system and the reactivity of the materials
        themselves.</li>
      <li>Extrapolate these results and to contribute to overall biogeochemical modeling in LBA by
        assimilating data on carbon, nitrogen, and moisture fluxes from experimental, tower and
        aircraft databased on the modeling and remote sensing activities of our EOS IDS project.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Research will concentrate in the Rio Ji-Paraná basin, and will be extended with more
modest measurements of other basins in Rondônia and arrayed along the LBA transects
elsewhere in the Amazon (at sites where significant local collaboration is feasible). We
will work along land-use and moisture gradients, with the intention of quantifying key
fluxes and understanding the underlying dynamics for river corridors. </p>

<p>We will (with final and exact details subject to further negotiations with LBA
partners): </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Develop a variable-scale drainage basin element model for biogeochemical processes
    which includes water balances and routing (in conjunction with hydrology work elsewhere in
    LBA). This will require development of multi-scale digital elevation models and spatial
    data layers (topography, soils, land use) sufficient to evaluate 4 km, 1 km, and
    ultimately 30 m resolution. The enhanced hydrological models will allow us to implement a
    more detailed consideration of the mechanistic processes and factors controlling within
    the CASA modeling environment of the evolution and partitioning of organic matter,
    nutrients, and trace gases. </p>
    <p>2. Establish and operate a distributed sampling network in the Rio Ji-Paraná basin
    which will allow us to measure the temporal variability in the distributions of water flux
    and attendant chemical composition at the exit to the basin, then progressively work our
    way upstream, sampling the diverse sub-regions, approaching the low order streams. To
    generalize results, we will explore lower resolution field areas elsewhere in Rondônia
    and in the Amazon. </p>
    <p>3. As these sites we will make measurements of hydrological parameters, groundwater and
    stream chemistry (NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, PO<sub>4</sub>, alkalinity, pH, O<sub>2</sub>,
    particulate and dissolved organic CNP, major anions and cations, and routine stable
    isotopes, surface area, individual amino acids, individual sugars, and lignin-derived CuO
    reaction products.), and(funding dependent) gas concentrations and fluxes (CH<sub>4</sub>,
    N<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub>). Sources of N<sub>2</sub>O through the d15-N and d18O
    of N<sub>2</sub>O, while transformations of ON to NO<sub>3</sub> using d15-N techniques.
    In-channel production and mineralization will be investigated with the distributions of
    dissolved gases (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, 18O<sub>2</sub>).
    </p>
    <p>4. Regional extrapolation in the overall context of biogeochemical cycling will be
    based on time series multispectral image measurements along the LBA transects to validate
    and determine uncertainties in remote sensing inputs (e.g., FPAR, net solar radiation,
    temperature, non-photosynthetic vegetation) from image data. These data are used as inputs
    to our EOS-IDS regional hydrology/biogeochemical cycling model. </p>
