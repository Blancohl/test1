<p>Objectives</p>

<p>Photosynthesis and respiration by vegetation and soil play a vital role in the carbon
cycle over the rain forest in the Amazônia region. Among various key factors in
determining these physiological processes by models are photosynthetically active
radiation (PAR), and the canopy and soil temperatures (Tc , Ts). For example, it has been
suggested that the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rates over the Amazon forest may be highly
sensitive to radiation and temperature. That the system may change from a sink to a source
in response to reduced radiation levels due to cloud cover or an average temperature rise
of a degree or less. However, our knowledge of the space-time distribution of PAR and Tc
is too incomplete to facilitate large-scale comprehensive modeling studies. The data
currently available for Amazônia come from only a few sites, and thus past studies of
this kind have been restricted to specific time periods and areas. Moreover, extrapolation
of datasets to larger spatial scales and longer time periods may not be appropriate
because of discontinuous processes controlling PAR and Tc. </p>

<p>Scientific Objectives</p>

<p>This proposal address these concerns with the following four main scientific
objectives: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>1. </b>Retrieval of the surface radiation budget over the large-scale Amazon basin,
    including retrieval of PAR, Tc, and Ts, based on GOES-8 satellite measurements; </p>
    <p><b>2</b>. Examination of net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange between the atmosphere and the
    soil-forest ecosystem as a function of land type and land-use based on a biosphere model
    forced with satellite-derived inputs; </p>
    <p><b>3. </b>Analysis of the basin-wide spatial and temporal variability of net CO<sub>2</sub>
    exchange; </p>
    <p><b>4.</b> Quantification of the effects of distribution of environmental variables such as
    cloudiness, boundary layer thermodynamics, and aerosol concentration on scaling up both in
    space and time of seasonal and basin-wide CO<sub>2</sub> exchange. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>Retrieval of the surface total solar fluxes and PAR fluxes is to be carried out with a
physical algorithm designed for GOES satellite measurements which has been successfully
applied to the BOREAS project. For the long-wave fluxes, we will use a new algorithm based
on the idea of energy balance for a surface layer. To obtain the canopy and soil
temperatures, we begin by retrieving surface radiometric skin temperature (Trs) from the
GOES split window channels, then employ an optimization procedure in conjunction with the
biosphere model to separate the Tc and Ts temperatures. The resulting datasets including
the SRB fluxes, PAR, Trs, Tc, Ts, and the CO<sub>2</sub> flux will be calculated over a 4
x 4-km grid at 30-minute time resolution. With these space and time resolutions, the
datasets are expected to play a vital role in various modeling studies to be undertaken
within the LBA-ECO project.<br>
</p>

<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> flux modeling is to be accomplished by forcing the biosphere model
with the above-derived radiation and temperature variables. The model will incorporate one
of the following physiological parameterizations, depending on available data: (1) scaling
leaf photosynthesis, respiration, and stomatal conductance to the canopy if canopy-level
data are not available; (2) canopy-level parameterization based on light-use-efficiency if
canopy-level data are available. The main results from the modeling efforts will be
detailed time series of the various CO<sub>2</sub> flux components at the high space-time
resolutions. </p>

<p>Scientific Importance</p>

<p>This will be the first detailed, quantitative study of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange over
large-scale Amazônia. The study is designed to take advantage of recent advances in
physiological and biosphere modeling, and the intrinsic high space-time resolution
capabilities of the GOES Imager. One of the motivations of this study is to determine the
space-time sampling requirements needed to obtain representative estimates of CO<sub>2</sub>
exchange over the Amazon basin. This process variability is controlled by the
heterogeneity of land cover, changing environmental factors in the planetary boundary
layer, and the highly variable cloud systems and aerosol plumes affecting tropical South
America.<br>
</p>

<p>It is our hypothesis that representative carbon budgets cannot be obtained by
monitoring at a limited number of point sites, even if all major land classifications are
sampled, because the processes controlling boundary layer thermodynamics and cloud
formation are not ergodic and thus require frequent sampling to ensure accurate
integration. Currently, we do not quantitatively understand the sources of carbon budget
variability in the rain forest, nor the best strategy to integrate up to basin scales from
the limited amount of information currently on hand. In conducting this study over the
large-scale basin, we expect to determine the major factors controlling CO<sub>2</sub>
flux exchange variability, which will help shed light on how changing climatic conditions
would be expected to alter carbon sequestering and its release in the Amazônia rain
forest. </p>

<p>Value of Results to LBA-ECO</p>

<p>The results are expected to contribute to the LBA-ECO scientific goals in several
ways. With high space-time resolution CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, we shall be able to estimate
the net CO<sub>2</sub> fixed by different land covers on different time scales by
integrating various components of the CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in time at selected sites.
Similarly, by integrating the CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in space, we shall be able to estimate
contributions by different land covers to basin-wide carbon accumulation. In addition,
with the high resolution radiation and temperature inputs, which are greatly affected by
cloudiness, boundary layer temperature-moisture, and aerosol concentration, we will be
able to quantify the effects of the variation of these environmental variables on scaling
up to seasonal and basin-wide scales. </p>
