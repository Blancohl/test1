<p>Objectives</p>

<p>Our objectives are to quantify and improve our understanding of the changes in C
storage, C exchange, and nutrient dynamics in response to human-induced environmental
change in Amazônia. We will address these goals using models of canopy gas-exchange and
ecosystem biogeochemistry. These models will allow us to use existing information and
information collected during the intensive field studies to generate regional
extrapolations, thus creating linkages in LBA between the specific point studies and the
remotely sensed data. </p>

<p>We will use a hierarchy of models to scale in space from point to region and in time
from hours to decades. </p>

<ol>
  <li>At the finest scale we will employ a process-based multi-layer canopy,
    soil-plant-atmosphere model (SPA) that predicts hourly gross photosynthesis and
    transpiration. This model is parameterized with fine-scale measurements of canopy
    structure and meteorology, and can be tested against independently collected tower eddy
    covariance flux measurements. We will also develop a transect version of the model to
    generate predictions of gas exchange along an aircraft flight path. The transect runs will
    necessarily be parameterized with less detailed data, and will allow us to investigate the
    effects of any simplifying assumptions on model efficacy. </li>
  <li>At the next coarser scale, we will use a simpler, aggregated model of daily whole-canopy
    carbon © fixation and transpiration. This model is derived wholly from the process-based
    model, capturing its aggregated behavior, while operating with daily input and at
    significantly higher computing speeds. This aggregated model serves two purposes. Firstly,
    it can be employed within a gridded GIS database, so that we can derive regional estimates
    of C and energy fluxes under specified land-use and climate change scenarios. Secondly, it
    can be inserted into our ecosystem biogeochemistry model as a validated
    photosynthesis/transpiration component. </li>
  <li>The third model, of ecosystem biogeochemistry (MBL-GEM), will be used to examine the
    coupling between nutrient dynamics and longer-term C storage and exchange. Our primary
    goal will be to test whether we can predict the long-term responses of biomass and soil
    organic matter to land-use change using chronosequence data for validation. This model
    will also be coupled with a GIS-database model to generate regional extrapolations. In
    this instance our predictions of regionally varying biomass and leaf area can be tested
    against remotely sensed data as a further test. </li>
</ol>

<p>The proposed work will represent a significant step toward an understanding of
Amazônia for three important reasons. Firstly, by identifying key functional differences
in canopy gas exchange characteristics our soil-plant-atmosphere model will help to
develop effective inter-site comparisons. Secondly, our models represent a logistically
effective means for generating linkages among components of LBA, particularly in terms of
linking the point measurements of towers with remotely-sensed regional data-sets. Our
aggregation protocols will help to generate coarser-scaled predictions, with more modest
data requirements, better suited for extrapolation. Thirdly, we will integrate the
understanding derived from tower-based flux measurements into our ecosystem biogeochemical
models. Understanding the linkages between C and nutrient cycles is crucial for developing
long-term predictions of the response of biomass and soil organic matter to land-use and
climate change. </p>

<p>We hope to work closely with those teams making eddy flux measurements, both from
towers and aircraft. We are also interested in collaborating with groups developing
regional data sets of land-cover, vegetation type and climate variables. We are searching
for a Brazilian or South American collaborator to work with us on model parameterization,
validation, analysis, and extrapolation. </p>
