Biomass
and rates of disturbance are major factors in determining the net flux of carbon
between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, and neither of them is well
known for most of the earth's surface. Satellite
data over large areas are beginning to be used systematically to measure rates
of two of the most important types of disturbance, deforestation and
reforestation, but these are not the only types of disturbance that affect
carbon storage. Other examples
include selective logging and fire. Logging
and subsequent regrowth of forests have contributed more to the net flux of
carbon between the atmosphere and temperate zone and boreal forests in recent
decades than any other type of land use. In
the tropics logging is also becoming increasingly important. According to the FAO/UNEP assessment of tropical forests, about 25% of
total area of productive forests have been logged one or more times in the 60-80
years before 1980. The fraction must be considerably greater at present. Thus,
deforestation by itself accounts for only a portion of the emissions carbon from
land. Furthermore, as rates of deforestation become more accurately measured
with satellites, uncertainty in biomass will become the major factor accounting
for the remaining uncertainty in estimates of carbon flux. An approach is needed
for determining the biomass of terrestrial ecosystems.



LBA Ecology offers an excellent opportunity to obtain spatially detailed
estimates of both disturbance and biomass for the same region and time. The work
described here will be of value to LBA Ecology in integrating ground
measurements of biomass and satellite-derived estimates of disturbance. The
spatial data on biomass will help quantify the emissions and sinks of carbon
from land management in Amazonia. They should also help interpret direct
measurements of CO2 flux at tower sites. That is, what portion of a
measured carbon sink can be explained by recovery from past disturbances, as
opposed to other environmental influences?<br>

The
work consists of (1) ground studies
in areas selectively logged and burned, where rates of wood removal, mortality,
and rates of forest growth are measured; (2) satellite
data (Landsat TM) to determine the rates, areal extent, and spatial
distribution of logging and fire in two areas along the arc of deforestation in
Amazonia; and (3) modeling to
determine the spatial distribution (a) of biomass resulting from current and
past rates of logging and fire and (b) of the net carbon flux associated with
these processes of disturbance and subsequent recovery. The goal is to develop
an approach to measurement of disturbance robust enough for use throughout
Amazonia as extensive satellite data become available for the region.<o:p>


<p>Study sites</p>

Fieldwork
measuring biomass and rates of growth following logging will be conducted at two
to three sites yet to be determined.

<p>Remote sensing</p>
First,
Landsat TM will be used in two to three regions to identify selectively logged
and burned areas through identification of logging scars (areas indicating
logging by roads in primary forest and &quot;patios&quot; or clearing for log
storage). Second, the spatial distribution of 2000 sawmills in Para and
elsewhere throughout Amazonia will be used to evaluate how readily selective
logging can be monitored remotely, how important selective logging is for
changes in forest biomass and carbon balance in the region, and the relationship
between logging and fire.

<p>Modeling</p>
Extensive
data on disturbance (hectares logged and burned) will be used in a model with
site-specific data (carbon/hectare) on rates of mortality, decay and regrowth to
calculate the releases and accumulations of carbon resulting from logging and
fire. The model is a cohort model that tracks the area, age, and biomass of
lands subjected to different kinds of disturbance.&nbsp;
