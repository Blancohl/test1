<p> Project Summary &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> This proposal is in response to the NASA NRA-00-OES-08 on
Carbon Cycle Science and on LBA ecology. Currently, long-term
variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are monitored by an array of
flux towers, such as AmeriFlux towers over North America and
EuroFlux towers in Europe. This long-term observational network
covers a variety of biomes and diverse geographic areas. However,
whether these towers capture the net carbon budget in the regions surrounding the towers and how we can scale-up these tower
measurements to regional or continental scales are still challenging issues. We propose to identify and quantify
carbon sources and sinks on the regional scale (around 100 km), and
study their temporal variability by using coordinated ground-based
and aircraft measurements with novel observational strategies.
We propose to use either the Wyoming King Air or NCAR C-130
aircraft at two experiment sites: the existing WLEF 450-m tower in
northern Wisconsin and the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) Experiment in
Amazonia. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>We will apply different strategies for measuring the daytime
and nighttime regional CO<sub>2 </sub>exchange. For the daytime regional CO<sub>2
</sub>exchange, we will directly&nbsp; measure the CO<sub>2 </sub>turbulent
flux close to the ground ecosystem. In addition, we will investigate the CO<sub>2
</sub>budget by measuring not only the
temporal and spatial variations of the CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration, but also
the advection of CO<sub>2</sub>, the CO<sub>2</sub>entrained at the top of the atmospheric boundary layer, and the CO<sub>2</sub>turbulent
transport. For the nighttime regional CO<sub>2</sub>, we will fly repeatedly
along a flight track during the early morning
transition period to measure the CO<sub>2 </sub>flux accumulated through the
night. Although focused primarily on CO<sub>2</sub>, we will also
survey&nbsp; spatial and temporal variations of the isoprene eddy flux as part of
the regional carbon study. To quantify the regional CO<sub>2</sub> transfer during the daytime, and to improve numerical modeling of the CO<sub>2
</sub>budget, we propose to use isoprene as a tracer to
measure the entrainment velocity at the top of the atmospheric
boundary &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The measured regional CO<sub>2 </sub>and isoprene fluxes will be
related to satellite land classifications and topography data to
estimate CO<sub>2 </sub>and isoprene fluxes on larger scales. By comparing
the measured regional CO<sub>2 </sub>fluxes from the aircraft with the
tower measurements at the two sites, we propose to improve the
accuracy of the long-term observation of CO<sub>2 </sub>exchange from the
AmeriFlux network and the tower network in Amazonia to represent
regional CO<sub>2 </sub>budgets.&nbsp;
