  (COBRA)-Brazil</b></span></p>

  <p>Motivation. The Amazon Basin is a key component of the
  global carbon<br>
  cycle, containing one-half of the world's undisturbed tropical forest<br>
  and accounting for ~10% of global terrestrial net primary<br>
  productivity.&nbsp; Current estimates of carbon fluxes in Amazonia at the<br>
  regional and Basin scales are subject to large uncertainties that<br>
  propagate into the global carbon budget.&nbsp; Regional and Basin scale<br>
  carbon exchanges fall into the &quot;missing scale&quot; in carbon cycle
  science<br>
  due to a) dearth of CO2 observations over the continent to constrain<br>
  inverse models and b) lack of independently validated methodologies to<br>
  scale up local measurements.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The proposed study will conduct in-situ airborne
  measurements<br>
  of CO2 and CO in the lower- and mid-troposphere over the Amazon Basin.<br>
  The proposed strategy for observations and analysis will provide<br>
  direct estimates of carbon fluxes at the missing regional and Basin<br>
  scales.&nbsp; We plan to conduct this study during both wet and dry seasons<br>
  to capture the seasonal variability and to complement LBA airborne<br>
  remote-sensing missions.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
  <p>Objectives</p>
  <p>directly quantify regional and Basin-scale fluxes in
  Amaztnia using<br>
  airborne measurements of CO2 and other tracers in and above the<br>
  planetary boundary layer (PBL);</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> establish the relationships
  between vertical concentration<br>
  gradients and exchange fluxes observed at the eddy flux towers in LBA<br>
  and over adjacent regions;</li>
    <li>
      <p> test hypotheses
  central to LBA that Amazonia is a major net<br>
  source or sink for CO2;</li>
    <li>
      <p> characterize
  horizontal and vertical distributions of<br>
  atmospheric CO2 over Amazonia for the purposes of planning remote<br>
  sensing instrumentation<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Approach</p>
  <p>The proposed strategy has been successfully implemented
  in a<br>
  pilot study (COBRA 2000) conducted over North America and consists of<br>
  the following complementary approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Lagrangian regional experiments: diurnal airborne
  measurements of<br>
  CO2, CO, and H2O within and above the PBL in an airmass-following<br>
  framework which yields regional fluxes and their variations across<br>
  different disturbance regimes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p>Eulerian experiments: vertical profiles at different
  times of the day<br>
  over selected locations yield first-order estimates of carbon fluxes<br>
  and define the diurnal variations for each region&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p>Large-scale surveys: sampling of large-scale CO2
  distribution along<br>
  the synoptic flow pattern, combined with knowledge of diurnal<br>
  variations from the Eulerian experiments, gives Basin-scale fluxes</li>
    <li>
      <p>Hemispheric-scale cross-sections: observations during
  transit flights<br>
  between North Dakota and Brazil will enable construction of CO2<br>
  cross-sections that span from the mid- to tropical latitudes</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br>
  Deliverables</p>
  <p>Direct estimates of CO2 fluxes at regional and Basin
  scales to test<br>
  ideas about net sources or sinks of CO2 in Amazonia, and against which<br>
  methods for scaling up local measurements can be evaluated, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Regional scale (~200-300km) CO2 fluxes in disturbed and
  undisturbed<br>
  regions of Amazonia</li>
    <li>
      <p>Basin scale flux estimates derived from large-scale
  horizontal and<br>
  vertical gradients</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Vertical and horizontal distributions of CO2 in the
  troposphere over<br>
  Amazonia and between the American Midwest and Brazil that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>improve estimates from inverse studies by filling an
  observational<br>
  gap</li>
    <li>
      <p>constrain CO2 fields generated by coupled
  atmosphere-biosphere models</li>
    <li>
      <p>assist in the development of space-borne sensors for
  measuring<br>
  atmospheric CO2</li>
    <li>
      <p>evaluation of a simpler method to quantify carbon
  fluxes, using<br>
  routine atmospheric profiling over the same location, which can be<br>
  more widely adopted.</li>
  </ul>
