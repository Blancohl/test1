    </span>This proposal is for a continuation of our existing project, BigFoot.
    The overall goal of BigFoot and the proposed BigFoot II project is to
    provide validation of MODLand (MODIS Land Science Team) science products,
    including land cover, leaf area index (LAI), fraction absorbed
    photosynthetic active radiation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(f<sub>APAR</sub>),
    and net primary production (NPP). To do so, we use ground measurements,
    remote sensing data, and ecosystem process models at sites representing
    different biomes. BigFoot sites are 5 x 5 km in size and surround the
    relatively small footprint (<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;WP MathA&quot;">.</span>1 km<sup>2</sup>) of CO<sub>2</sub>
    flux towers. At each site we make multi-year <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">in
    situ</i> measurements of ecosystem structure and functional characteristics
    that are related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Our sampling design allows
    us to explicitly examine scales of fine-grained spatial pattern in these
    properties, and provides for a field-based ecological characterization of
    the flux tower footprint. Multi-year measurements ensure that inter-annual
    validity of MODLand products can be assessed.</p>
    <p style="mso-pagination:none;tab-stops:-.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in -1.0in"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>In BigFoot II, for each measurement year we will derive land cover, f<sub>APAR</sub>,
    and LAI surfaces by linking our <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">in
    situ</i> measurements to Landsat ETM+ data. These BigFoot surfaces will be
    developed using logic that preserves functionally important fine-grained
    information. Errors in these surfaces will be quantified and the surfaces
    summarized to provide a characterization of vegetation patterns in the
    greater flux tower footprint. Using these land cover and LAI surfaces and
    derived climate surfaces, we will model NPP over the 5 x 5 km BigFoot
    footprint. Two independent ecosystem process models will be used: Biome-BGC
    and IBIS. The ability of the models to capture environmental and ecological
    controls on water and carbon cycles will be assessed with the following
    comparisons: modeled NPP against <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">in
    situ</i> measurements of NPP, modeled GPP to tower-based calculations of GPP,
    and modeled daily water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes to tower estimates.
    We will validate MODLand land cover, LAI, f<sub>APAR</sub>, and NPP surfaces
    by comparing them to BigFoot surfaces derived using field measurement data.
    A series of exercises that isolate important scaling factors will be
    conducted, so that their effects on NPP model estimates can be better
    understood. This will involve rerunning the models after converting
    site-specific land cover classes into broad, globally applicable classes,
    successive coarsening of land cover and LAI surface grain size, and
    generalizing the light use efficiency factor (<span style="font-family:&quot;WP Greek Century&quot;">g</span>)
    to coincide with the more generalized land cover classes.</p>

    </span>The proposed BigFoot II study will be conducted at nine sites
    (several supported by separate funding) that span eight major biomes, from
    desert to tundra, to tropical forest. At these sites, in addition to
    validation of MODIS products, we will quantify carbon content and NPP,
    examine how these variables vary spatially and temporally, and how NPP is
    related to climatic variables. Collectively, the standardized NPP data from
    the contrasting biomes will elucidate biophysical controls on NPP, and their
    sensitivitiy to changing climate and land use. Our standardized data also
    allow for direct testing of whether light use efficiency (LUE) differs among
    plant functional types, or seasonally for a given type.</p>

    </span>A global terrestrial observation system is needed to assist in the
    validation of global products such as land cover and NPP from MODIS and
    other sensor and modeling programs. A key component of such a system is the
    eddy flux tower network, FLUXNET; however, flux sensors measure net
    ecosystem productivity (NEP), not NPP. BigFoot is learning how NEP and NPP
    are related, and through modeling, how to integrate a wide range of carbon
    cycle observations. Another key component of an observing system is the use
    of remote sensing and models to scale tower fluxes and field measurements.
    Although this may be relatively common at a given site, no other project is
    doing so with standardized methods across so many biomes. As such, BigFoot
    is a pathfinding activity that will contribute to the development of useful
    scaling principles. The project can also serve as a nucleus for the global
    terrestrial observing system that is needed to validate global, generalized
    products used to monitor the health of the terrestrial biosphere.</p>
