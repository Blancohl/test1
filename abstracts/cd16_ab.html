  <p style="margin-left:0in">Cycles
  of carbon and nitrogen in forest ecosystems are tightly linked through a
  shared set of biological processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
  the leaf level, rates of net photosynthesis have been related to nitrogen
  concentrations among species from diverse biomes around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>At the canopy level, nitrogen concentrations have been related to rates
  of forest production, soil C:N ratios and rates of N cycling.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In aggregate, this suggests that remote sensing of foliar
  nitrogen chemistry can offer an elegant yet powerful approach to scaling
  point-based carbon flux measurements to local landscapes or regions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In one recent study, data from NASA&#146;s AVIRIS sensor was successfully
  used to map aboveground NPP and soil carbon to nitrogen ratios across a large
  and heterogeneous forest landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here,
  we propose to extend this approach across wider temporal and spatial scales in
  a range of forest ecosystems that span a boreal to tropical gradient, where
  carbon flux measurements are available from eddy covariance towers and
  extensive plot-based measurements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
  sites to be analyzed are part of the AmeriFlux or FLUXNET CO<sub><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">2</span></sub> exchange research programs and include Howland, ME;
  Harvard Forest, MA; Duke Forest, NC; Walker Branch, TN, Gainsville, FL; and
  two moist tropical sites in the Tapajos National Forest near Santarem, Brazil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This will enhance current knowledge of forest carbon cycles in a number
  of important ways:<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p><b>(1)</b> At each site, we will supplement existing field data with new
  measurements to build complete data sets for foliar chemistry, biomass
  production and soil C:N ratios in order to examine relations among these
  variables both within and across sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hyperspectral
  remote sensing data will be acquired from NASA&#146;s AVIRIS and Hyperion
  instruments for development of data planes for foliar chemistry and associated
  carbon fluxes using relationships observed within the field data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This will provide insight into the nature and generality of forest
  carbon-nitrogen relations across ecosystems and climate regimes and could open
  exciting new possibilities for mapping fine-scale patterns of growth in other
  regions around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><b>(2)</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In building our field and remote sensing campaign around AmeriFlux and
  FLUXNET research sites, the proposed work will bring the added benefit of
  allowing eddy covariance CO<sub><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></sub>
  exchange measurements to be interpreted for the first time with respect to
  patterns of remotely-sensed canopy chemistry within the surrounding
  landscapes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We propose several
  approaches to undertaking this, including qualitative analyses of CO<sub><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></sub> exchange with respect to varying wind
  direction and associated canopy nitrogen levels as well as spatially-explicit
  application of a forest ecosystem model.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in"><b>(3)</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whereas scaling measurements from individual field plots or eddy flux
  towers to surrounding landscapes represents one important challenge to carbon
  cycling science, gaining a comprehensive picture of terrestrial carbon cycles
  requires the additional ability to scale such information beyond to both
  regional and continental scales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
  the large spatial extent of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>broad-scale
  instruments such as AVHRR and MODIS brings added difficulties of
  interpretation and validation because the large grid cells such instruments
  generate cannot be compared directly to field measurements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The detailed, landscape-level coverages of canopy nitrogen and related
  forest carbon fluxes the proposed study will generate will provide a
  much-needed bridge between field measurements of forest biomass production and
  estimates derived from MODIS.</p>
