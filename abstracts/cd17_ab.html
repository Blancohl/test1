      <p>This proposal is in response to the NASA-Carbon Cycle
      Science and LBA-Ecology Program request for remote sensing research and
      the development of methods and datasets for exploring the response of
      ecosystems to disturbance at the regional scale.&nbsp; We propose a four-step, incremental approach directed toward
      the spatially explicit modeling and mapping of forest regrowth potential
      for the Amazon region. Each of the four steps will make a significant
      contribution to current understanding of the response of ecosystems to
      disturbance at the regional scale.&nbsp; Developing
      an ability to predict forest regrowth potential has considerable
      implications for our understanding of carbon dynamics in a future
      characterized by increased conversion of old-growth Amazonian forests and
      the subsequent abandonment of many areas originally cleared for
      agricultural activities. A central focus of our approach is the
      development of remote sensing approaches for quantifying vegetation
      recovery and changes in biomass following disturbance, determination of
      the optimal scale for these approaches, and testing of
      disturbance-specific parameters that may influence rates of forest
      regrowth in Amazonia.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
  </p>
      <p>Step 1 is the
      production of preliminary forest regrowth potential maps for the region
      using an empirical model of biomass accumulation in global secondary
      forests (Johnson et al.2000; see Appendix B).&nbsp; The maps are a spatially explicit application of model algorithms
      within a GIS framework constrained by readily available regional datasets
      on climate and soil texture.&nbsp; Step
      1 products include maps illustrating potential biomass accumulation in
      Amazonian regrowth forests at 5-year intervals (Zarin et al. submitted;
      see Appendix C).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
  </p>
      <p>Step 2 is the
      definition of a set of normalized spectral indices of forest regrowth
      optimized for the Amazon region.&nbsp; These
      indices will be derived from MASTER and multi-temporal Landsat TM/
      ETM+data and calibrated against field measurements of regrowth structure
      and estimates of canopy height and vertical distribution. The ideal
      resolution for these spectral indices will be quantified. Expected
      products from Step 2 include forest regrowth data bundles that will
      contain age and land use history for each stand, temporal sequences of
      regrowth indices, derived canopy height, canopy profiles and canopy
      structural properties for a subset of regrowth stands.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
  </p>
      <p>Step 3 is the
      testing of the reliability of the preliminary maps (Step 1 product) and
      the remote sensing indices of regrowth structure (Step 2 products). We
      will employ traditional validation methods to compare the spatially
      explicit model predictions with forest inventory data not included in the
      development of the model.&nbsp; Validation
      is used here in a strictly statistical sense.&nbsp; Using independent data, we will assess the bias and variance
      characteristics of the global model when used as a regional predictor,
      including partitioning the variance components into local (within-site)
      and regional (between-site) components.&nbsp; And although the model was developed with reference to regrowth
      biomass, we will also test its applicability to the prediction of regrowth
      structure as expressed by the spectral indices defined in Step 2.&nbsp; AIRSAR estimates of biomass will be tested and compared to assess
      between-site and seasonal differences in SAR based biomass retrievals.
      Expected products from Step 3 are spatially explicit accuracy assessment
      of regrowth maps for biomass and structure, based on both field and
      remotely-sensed data.&nbsp; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
  </p>
      <p>Step 4 is the
      refinement of the global model to enhance its regional applicability by
      including known disturbance-specific parameters shown to explain a
      significant amount of variance between measured and modeled regrowth
      biomass and structure.&nbsp; We
      will test parameters that describe disturbance type, size, perimeter:area
      ratio and land-use history, including the number of agricultural cycles
      and persistence of the various stages of vegetation cover.&nbsp; Remote sensing based observations are required to adequately test
      the importance of these disturbance-specific parameters with a sufficient
      number of observations. A subset of the forest inventory data will be used
      to calibrate this regional enhancement of the model.&nbsp; Model selection will employ cross-validation with reserved
      independent data, or resampling cross-validation techniques, to avoid
      overfitting and to assess expected prediction errors.&nbsp; The resulting spatial pattern of predictions will also be compared
      to the spatial pattern of the spectral indices defined in Step 2. The
      principal products of Step 4 will be a regionally refined and
      accuracy-assessed forest regrowth potential model and derivative maps that
      will provide our best predictions (and corresponding error estimates) for
      the regional responses of biomass and forest structure to current and
      future land-use patterns in Amazonia.<o:p>
