<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We propose studies in two theme areas of LBA Ecology: land
use and land cover change (LULCC), and Carbon Storage and Exchange. This will
involve examining the human and biophysical dimensions of land use and land
cover (LULC) in the Ecuadorian Amazon associated with high rates of spontaneous
colonization by agricultural settlers migrating into the region since the early
1970&#146;s. A satellite time series from 1973 to 1999, along with GIS thematic
coverage of biophysical gradients and geographical accessibility, was linked to
data collected on the ground from a probability sample of geo-referenced farm
household plots and communities. Data were collected on the latter in 1999 for
the same settler plots originally surveyed in 1990 to measure LULC over time in
detail, and to study the relationships between LULC and population and
socioeconomic characteristics of settler households. Image processing to
characterize LULC and spatial analyses of landscape structure was used to assess
the rate and nature of LULC and to model the effects of LULC, secondary plant
succession, and land fragmentation on carbon budgets and assimilation rates for
landscape strata and the study area as a whole. Statistical models were used to
estimate the demographic, socioeconomic, biophysical, and geographic
determinants of LULC. Agricultural extensification and intensification have both
been observed and documented at the three spatial scales of the farm plot, the
sector or community of the plots, and the region as a whole.</p>
<p>The project was carried out in an area of the Amazon
headwaters, one characterized by extraordinary biodiversity, undergoing more
rapid colonization and deforestation than elsewhere in the Western Amazon due to
its being opened up by roads following the discovery of large oil deposits. A
scientifically representative sample of 420 settler household plots covered in
1990 was re-visited in 1999 to provide a unique assessment of changes in LULC
over time, including land extensification, land intensification (and
sustainability of agricultural technology), land abandonment, and secondary
succession, with implications for the carbon budget. <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:

therefore forest preservation</span></p>

<p>Activities</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GIS: Acquire remote sensing images, historical and
    current base maps and maps of roads and towns and infrastructure (to the
    extent possible, such as for schools, health clinics, oil camps, sawmills,
    coffee roasters, etc.), hydrography, topography, aerial photography
    (available only for 1990). Order GPS units and load software onto<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>laptops for data collection and differential correction. Preprocess
    satellite data and digitize maps into ARC/INFO format. Train Ecociencia
    (Ecuador) staff in use of GPS devices and GIS. 1998-99<o:p>
    </o:p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Household and Community Surveys. Prepare household- and
    community-level questionnaires. Recruit and train interviewers in Ecuador.
    Conduct pretests of questionnaires and of GPS devices and calibrate measures
    of land use with satellite imagery. Procure supplies for fieldworkers.
    Conduct household survey<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>comprising interviews of heads of households and spouses
    (February-September, 1999). Clean and process survey data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Conduct community survey, of 60 communities, June, 2000. Clean and
    process community data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>LULC classification validation using both ground/survey
    and satellite data. 2000</li>
  <li>
    <p>Carbon storage and sequestration. Estimate biomass and
    leaf area. Assess pattern metrics and landscape structure associated with
    fragmentation. Estimate carbon dynamics associated with LULC. 2000-2001.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Assess extent of extensification and intensification of
    agricultural land use on plots, and determinants thereof. Conduct
    multivariate and multi-level analyses of LULC, derive policy implications;
    prepare papers for presentation at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>conferences,
    journal submission and a book in both English and Spanish, 2000-2001.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer data and technology to Ecuador/Ecociencia and
    other LBA investigators. 2000-2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note
    two Ecuadorian interviewers already used the household survey data as the
    basis for their theses for college degrees in Ecuador.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>And both satellite images and survey data have been supplied to the
    Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment to assist it in monitoring illegal
    deforestation in the Amazon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li>
    <p>Organize and carry out extensive dissemination
    activities in Ecuador, for migrant colonist farmers and leaders, in the
