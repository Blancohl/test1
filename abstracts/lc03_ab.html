<p>Objectives</p>

<p>This proposal supports the scientific goals of LBA in the following technical theme
areas: (1) land-cover and land-use change, (2) carbon storage and exchange and (3) trace
gas fluxes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The main cross-cutting themes of the proposed effort are: (1) remote sensing, (2) field
        observations and (3) GIS development.</li>
      <li>Our specific objectives are to use archival orbital imaging radar data (1) to produce
        land-cover classifications of the Amazon basin, (2) to collaborate in mapping of surface
        inundation extent/duration, (3) to estimate aboveground biomass and (4) to collaborate in
        estimation of the biotic carbon pool.</li>
    </ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A prototype classifier using orthorectified composites of ERS and JERS
SAR data has already been developed and tested on a number of NSF Long-Term Ecological
Research Sites and a moist tropical site west of Manaus. Simulations (using SIR-C data)
have shown the classifier to be readily adapted to use of the C-band and hh-polarized
channel provided by Radarsat. A large number of polygons will need to be inventoried to
support classifier development and validation. </p>

<p>Prototype biomass algorithms have also been developed and tested using data acquired by
SIR-C, and need refinement and validation for tropical forest types. The orthorectified
results will be expressed as digital thematic maps and placed into the LBA GIS. </p>

<p>The issue of spatial scaling will be explicitly treated within a subsample of primary
and secondary LBA sites via a nested approach using high spatial resolution data (i.e.,
SIR-C/X-SAR or airborne SAR if and when available) and lower resolution orbital data
(i.e., ERS/JERS/Radarsat at full resolution and also degraded to 100-m resolution). The
JERS and Radarsat data were acquired during two sampling periods in 1996. These results
will be cascaded into products generated at 100-m resolution for both the main LBA
transects (during the first three years) and over the full basin (during the ensuing three
years). </p>

<p>The temporal domain will also be explicitly treated. Wet and dry season composites will
be used to ascertain (1) inundation extent and (2) land-cover change over a 6-month period
(nominally for 1996). In addition, it is expected that the future availability of Light
SAR and/or PALSAR data (in the year 2000 to 2002 time frame) may provide the opportunity
for evaluation of decadal-scale changes as well. </p>

<p>The remote sensing effort will be supported by field-level activities to help define a
network of known land-cover polygons for evaluation of the classification and also conduct
biometry of land-cover types (undisturbed forest, regenerating forest, etc.) for
validation of biomass/carbon retrieval algorithms. The project includes remote sensing
scientists, electrical engineers and biologists with collaborative Brazilian
participation. </p>
