<p>Objectives</p>

<p>Our study addresses the LBA Ecology theme of carbon storage and exchange. We propose a
combination of field studies and computer modeling to estimate above-ground biomass in
continuous forest, forest fragments, and secondary forests of different types through time
and to relate these measures to remote sensing data from LANDSAT TM images for a modified
landscape in central Amazonia. Our objective is to develop a predictive model of carbon
stocks and their dynamics based on readily identifiable landscape features derived from
remote sensing imagery. </p>

<b>

<p>BIOMASS DYNAMICS IN CONTINUOUS PRIMARY FOREST AND REMNANTS:</b> We will use extensive
existing data from a long-term phyto-demographic project in the Amazon, coupled with
additional fieldwork, to estimate standing biomass in continuous forest plots and forest
fragments. This unique data set includes over 57,000 marked trees in 66 permanent, one-
hectare plots. These plots were surveyed initially more than 15 years ago, and have been
re-censured 2-5 times to estimate tree growth, mortality, damage, and recruitment, thereby
allowing us to monitor the dynamics of Amazonian tree communities and their intrinsic
carbon stocks at a landscape level (ca. 1000 km<sup>2</sup>). In this project, we will
re-survey tree communities in all 66 permanent plots. Lianas will also be included in
these surveys because recent results suggest that they could exhibit markedly increased
growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<b>

<p>BIOMASS DYNAMICS OF REGENERATING FORESTS:</b> We will develop biomass estimates for
different ages and types of secondary forest, in order to assess the rate of carbon
accumulation in fallow and regenerating lands following different successional
trajectories. Both species-specific allometric equations and true destructive sampling in
the field will allow the calculation of biomass estimates. </p>

<b>

<p>LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS:</b> We will use detailed time-series remote sensing imagery of our
extensive (20 X 50 km) research landscape in the central Amazon to produce a model of
carbon dynamics as a function of identifiable landscape features (e.g., fragment size and
shape, and the area and age of secondary forests). The procedure for the satellite
analyses will be the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Register all the thematic mapper images to a high resolution UTM map with precision
    GPS data from the field </p>
    <p>2. Image to image registration will then be performed using the base map as the
    reference base </p>
    <p>3. An unsupervised cluster classification will be run in conjunction with a
    knowledge-based classifier to classify the 20 x 50 km proposed study area into the 11
    categories above </p>
    <p>4. The resulting classification will field checked and corrected where necessary for
    each of the satellite images used in this study, based upon reference data collected in
    the field using GPS, photographs, field notes, and aerial overflights </p>
    <p>5. The resulting classification will be &quot;vectorized&quot; into an ArcInfo coverage
    and further edited where necessary </p>
    <p>6. Additional GIS layers of topography, river courses, roads, and biological
    information, including biomass estimates for each time frame, will be co-registered with
    the satellite data and included into the GIS </p>
    <p>7. The resulting combination of the satellite classification(s) from
    1982-1984-1986-1988-1990-1992-1994-1996 will be used to extrapolate the biological data
    spatially over the landscape. </p>

<p>Products of Proposed Research</p>

<p>The proposed research will provide the following products within the three years of
operation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Estimates of above-ground biomass stocks and their dynamics in primary tropical
    rainforest, in rainforest patches of varying sizes, and in different types and ages of
    secondary forests. </p>
    <p>2. A spatially explicit model that links temporal changes in the BDFFP landscape to
    predicted aboveground biomass stocks and their dynamics of above-ground biomass. </p>
    <p>3. A working model of biomass dynamics and landscape features, available for testing in
    other Amazonian landscapes. </p>
    <p>4. Training Brazilian graduate students and research professionals (in-country
    capacity- building). </p>
