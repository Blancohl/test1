<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The MODIS Instrument Land Science Team (MODLAND) proposes to provide, evaluate, and
validate an array of standard data products as tools for moderate resolution land surface
monitoring and ecology over Amazonia.<br>
The LBA experiment and sites will enable us to evaluate the quality and performance of our
products in conjunction with in-situ measures of various ecological parameters. MODLAND
will make available level 2 and level 3 gridded MODIS data products to the LBA-ECO
Science Team so as to maximize data usefulness and evaluation by the broader scientific
community. We plan on working over both LBA transects, encompassing dry and wet tropical
forests, cerrado, and various classes of land use conversions. </p>

<p><br>
The MODIS land discipline group is developing remote sensing algorithms for deriving
time-series data products of various terrestrial geophysical parameters, useful to
regional-scale ecological studies of Amazonia.<br>
Atmospheric Correction and Surface Reflectance: MODIS will provide atmospherically
corrected (Rayleigh, ozone, water, and aerosols) data sets over the LBA sites in bands
1-7, centered at 648 nm, 858 nm, 470 nm, 555 nm, 1240 nm, 1640 nm, and 2130 nm with
respective resolutions of 250 m (bands 1,2); and 500 m (bands 3-7).<br>
Land Surface Temperature and Fire Products: MODIS will provide daytime and nighttime LST
at 1 km and 5 km spatial resolutions, at daily, 8-day and monthly temporal frequencies.
The MODIS fire products will provide information on the distribution of fires and their
frequency and timing. The active fire products will be generated shortly after launch
(6/98) and the burned area products are planned for release one year later.<br>
Vegetation Indices (Vis) and Biophysical Products: Two vegetation indices will be produced
at 16-day and monthly intervals; the standard Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) and an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) designed for extended sensitivity into high
biomass, chlorophyll-saturated, conditions. A number of vegetation biophysical parameters
will be produced to describe vegetation canopy structure (LAI) and the fraction of
absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR). The LAI and fPAR products will be
produced at 8- and 16-day intervals. MODIS will also produce a Net Photosynthesis/ Net
Primary Productivity product utilizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of the LAI/ FPAR
products in conjunction with a BIOME-BGC ecosystem simulation model.<br>
Land Cover and Land Cover Change: MODIS is developing two products, a Land Cover
(classification) product that will map the terrestrial surface of the world into land
cover classes; and a Land Cover Change product that will detect areas of change and
identify the type of change process occurring. The algorithm for mapping global
terrestrial land cover will be at a 1 km resolution. The land cover change product will
detect areas of change and identify types of change processes as they occur.<br>
Spectral Albedo and BRDF: The MODLAND team will produce a global BRDF product at 1km
spatial resolution for the entire terrestrial surface at 16-day intervals, utilizing both
MODIS and MISR data sets. </p>

<p>Preferred Site</p>

<p>We plan on validating our products at all LBA sites, particularly in the vicinity of
the LBA-towers. </p>

<p>Activities</p>

<p>We plan to begin providing and archiving MODIS imagery of each product in September
1998. Most of our field activities related to validation will be conducted in coordination
with the LBA science team and LBA field activities. We plan to participate in joint field
activities with the LBA science team once a clear experimental plan is formed. </p>
