</p>

<p>Overview</p>

<p>The objective of this research is to understand the interactive effects of changes in
land-use and climate on 1) carbon storage and nutrient dynamics, including trace gas
fluxes, in terrestrial ecosystems and 2) the prospect for sustainable land-use in
Amazonia. <br>
</p>

<p>The specific product of the research will be a set of coupled, hierarchically
structured models accessible through a common model framework. This framework will provide
the means for investigating our principal objectives. We shall consider the LBA region
within the context of two broad environmental conditions: 1) natural ecosystems where
perturbations in biogeochemical states are driven primarily by natural variability of
climate and fire, and 2) disturbance gradients that are induced by human land-use
activities and/or human-induced climate change.<br>
</p>

<p>We will use our models of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, vegetation dynamics,
hydrology and land-use change. We will concentrate on model improvements to ensure
applicability of all models to the LBA study region. The ecosystem and hydrology models
will be driven by the physical climate; whereas, the land-use model will be driven by
biophysical, ecological, and economic constraints. The linked models will be incorporated
into a Geographic Information systems (GIS) context, accessing numerous data sets from LBA
or data layers housed at our institutions. We will evaluate model performance by
comparison and field measurements from LBA as well from published data sources. We will
use satellite remote sensing analysis as a means to evaluate the spatial and temporal
patterns of model performance at the regional scale. Finally, we will apply formal
statistical methods to characterize model uncertainty, as we apply this work to the
question of the human impacts on the Amazonian landscape.<br>
</p>

<p>Change from both natural and anthropogenic sources must be appropriately understood.
Therefore, we will focus on three objectives: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The natural pattern of variability in net primary production, respiration, nutrient
        availability, and the flux of trace gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the
        atmosphere</li>
      <li>Human-altered land-cover and ecosystem distribution and condition</li>
      <li>The associated changes in the pattern of net primary production, respiration, nutrient
        availability, and the flux of trace gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the
        atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Science Objectives</p>

<p>Our research effort links three Objectives. The First Objective focuses on the
biogeochemistry of terrestrial systems under the forcing of natural climate variability.
Among the topics of interest are the natural pattern of variability in net primary
production, respiration, nutrient availability, and the flux of trace gases between
terrestrial (including seasonally flooded) ecosystems and the atmosphere. Soil moisture
and inundation are also important components of this research because of their controls on
trace gas dynamics. In Objective Two, we address the problem of modeling the transient
dynamics of human-altered terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural systems, stages
of succession, and the combined forcing of various land-use and climate change patterns.
The Third Objective both supports and synthesizes the preceding Objectives. It provides a
Geographical Information System (GIS) framework for model development, evaluation, and
application. Within the model evaluation theme we will exploit remote sensing, using AVHRR
and when available, MODIS and MISR data from EOS AM-1, as well as formal error analysis
based upon spatial-temporal statistical techniques. We will use the linked model to
explore impacts of land-use and climate change scenarios on the biogeochemistry of the
region. </p>

<p>Key Tools</p>

<p>Amazonia contains some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, experiences
notable patterns of climate variability on seasonal to inter-annual time-scales, and is
undergoing significant changes in land-use. It is thus a region with important fluxes and
changes in fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and water. Regional-scale ecosystem modeling,
database development and remote sensing analysis will be important tools for evaluating
potential consequences of land-use change on the biogeochemistry in Amazonia. Key themes
and tools for our work will include modeling of natural and human-managed ecosystems,
remote sensing, GIS analysis, and large database assembly and dissemination. </p>

<p>Analysis of Natural Ecological Systems</b><br>
We have used the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model/Water Balance Model (TEM/WBM) to explore
seasonal and climatic variations in net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic
respiration (Rh), and net ecosystem production (NEP) for South America, North America, and
the globe. TEM is a process-based ecosystem simulation model that uses spatially
referenced information on climate, elevation, soils, and vegetation to make monthly
estimates of important carbon and nitrogen fluxes and pool sizes. A key feature of TEM is
that the carbon, water, and nitrogen cycles are closely coupled.<br>
</p>

<p>In order to address the effect of climate variability and climate change, we are
developing a transient version of TEM and have used a preliminary version to explore the
response of terrestrial ecosystems to historical changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration and climate in Amazonia, the conterminous United States, high latitude
ecosystems, and the globe (see also DNDC discussion in the next subsection (i.e., III.
2)). Inter-annual variations of modeled NPP in Amazonia were primarily associated with
inter-annual variations of precipitation. Inter-annual variations in modeled Rh were
smaller and connected mainly with inter-annual variations of temperature. The different
transient responses of these two carbon fluxes indicate that even under natural
conditions, the region sometimes acts as a sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and at
other times as a source. Within Amazonia, the spatial distribution of carbon sources and
sinks also apparently change from year to year. This behavior appears to be linked to the
physical climate through ENSO events.
</p>

<p>Our earlier work in Amazonia showed the dependence of NPP on water availability. The
capability to model and understand changes in the Amazon regional water system is
important to studies of terrestrial productivity, and also the significant effects of
floodplain inundation on trace gas emissions. </p>

<b>

<p>Studies of Managed and Disturbed Ecosystems</b><br>
We are currently developing a model for land-cover and land-use change. The model consists
of: 1) a land evaluation module that assesses the suitability and availability of land for
crops and pasture based on biophysical constraints such as climate, soil and topography,
and 2) a land-use module, GEOMOD, for simulating spatial patterns of land-use/land-cover
as well as the rates of change from landscape to regional scales based upon biophysical
factors and socio- economic factors (e.g., population density, land tenure system, timber
price). Algorithms within GEOMOD represent the principles of adjacency, dispersion,
regional heterogeneity, relative growth, energy efficiency, and resource quality.
</p>

<p>Conversion of land to pasture and cropland has had a significant impact on the
biogeochemistry of many areas of Amazonia, and these ecosystems must be included in any
regional analysis. The DNDC model can be used to simulate carbon and nutrient
biogeochemistry in agro-ecosystems. DNDC has simulated 30 years of pasture biogeochemistry
following conversion of forest to pasture. Estimated SOM and N2O fluxes are in general
accord with a chronosequence study in Costa Rica and simulation of NO flux from fertilized
maize grown on recently cleared land is also in agreement with measurement. DNDC has
successfully simulated N2O fluxes and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in temperate and
subtropical regions. DNDC has been used to simulate N<sub>2</sub>O flux from agricultural
lands in the U.S., and is currently being used to evaluate N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from
agricultural lands in China, including wet subtropical areas. Tropical agriculture and
pasture simulations with DNDC have been focused on Costa Rica, and will be adapted to the
LBA region. </p>

<p>Management of Data and GIS Capabilities</b><br>
Our NASA EOS-IDS and Hughes Applied Information Systems are collaborative partners in a
prototyping project that will provide full GIS capability over the internet and is fully
interoperable with NASA's EOS Data and Information System Core System (ECS). One aspect of
this effort to provide a means for LBA participants to conduct geo-spatial data searches
and queries via the internet. We currently have a very rough prototype
(http://www.unh-ecs.sr.unh.edu using a Java client and server, a Spatial Data Engine
(SDE/ESRI) client and server, and an Oracle database (which provides access to several
data layers including information from the Humid Tropical Forest Inventory Project (HTFIP)
which is part of NASA's Landsat Pathfinder Project); additional data layers are available
from our EOS-IDS research effort including Hydro-Climatology layers provided by the UNH
Global Hydrology Research Group). Recently approved funding through the NASA CAN
addressing Federation of the EOSDIS will allow a significant expansion of this capability.
</p>

<p>Remote Sensing</p>

<p>Issues related to validating spatial patterns of model predictions have been explored
using remote sensing. We examined model results of the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and
Analysis Project of net primary productivity (NPP), estimated in the conterminous USA at a
spatial resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 degree grids. One goal was to check the realism of the
spatial variability of model estimates using long-term monthly mean NDVI for each 0.5x0.5
grid cell, using the fact that NPP and NDVI are linearly related. Correlation for the
entire domain were relatively high (R2=0.6-0.7). However, comparison of the mean deviates
of both NDVI and simulated NPP (each grid cell value subtracted from the mean of all grid
cell values in an ecosystem type) were uncorrelated within biomes. Thus the models
appeared to be representing across-biome patterns of NPP, but no conclusion could be made
about within-biome variability. This type of analysis is potentially very powerful for
evaluating model-predicted NPP.
</p>

<p>A remotely sensed vegetation index can also yield insight into patterns of response of
ecosystems to climate, providing a means to evaluate model response and model-based
hypotheses. We used global AVHRR data and gridded air temperature from the Microwave
Sounding Unit to estimate the magnitude of immediate and lagged response to temperature.
Patterns of zero-, one-, and two-year lagged responses of NDVI to temperature variability
were ecosystem dependent and consistent with the hypothesis that biogeochemical mechanisms
play an important role in mediating global relationships between CO<sub>2</sub> and
temperature.
</p>

<p>We have successfully retrieved canopy biophysical variables, including the fraction of
PAR absorbed by the canopy (fAPAR) and albedo, using a radiative transfer model and AVHRR
data for a transect in the Central African Republic. Though observations of a single pixel
have single sun-sensor geometry, we gathered neighboring pixels in temporally composited
scenes, having similar functional ecosystem type, in order to simulate a multiple sampling
of geometry within approximately 0.5x0.5 &quot;cells&quot;. With the advent of MISR data
from EOS AM-1, we expect both improved accuracy and the ability to perform inversions
using much smaller spatial windows. </p>
