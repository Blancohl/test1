on 25 years of research experience in the Eastern Amazon, this study will focus
on advancing our understanding of land use and land cover change. This project
will build on a seven-region study, along the LBA transects, supported for&nbsp;
the past six years by NSF and NIGEC, and encompassing a sample of 100+
sites.&nbsp; We used a nested-georeferenced
approach that included soil analysis, vegetation stand structure and
composition, land use histories, institutional analyses, demography of
households, and land cover classification using Landsat TM multitemporal data to
understand the rates of growth of secondary vegetation.&nbsp; The seven regions&#146; study provides a wide array of&nbsp;
land uses and land cover along an east-to-west transect extending from
the Amazon estuary and Bragantina region east of Belém near the Atlantic coast,
all the way to the Tapajos/Santarem region.&nbsp; This 160,000 km2 area will be examined for land cover changes
and their relation to past patterns of land use for a minimum of no less than 25
years.&nbsp; We propose in this NASA/LBA
project to extend this work by:<o:p>

study will begin to develop a Spectral Library to facilitate inter-image

campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp; Building this
Spectral Library is a challenge that we can undertake only because of the
comprehensive nature of past georeferenced field research encompassing physical,
biological and social science variables, and because of its spatial distribution
over seven different regions that permits scaling from farm/household to
regional dimensions of land use and land cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
