<p>Objectives</p>

<p>This proposal seeks to understand the inter-annual variability in deforestation and
abandonment rates in the Brazilian Amazon region. We propose six Tasks, which integrate
satellite remote sensing measurements at basin, and site scales field-based case studies
at the farm and household scale, and models. We propose to couple our results with other
projects and studies under LBA, providing data and models on deforestation rates, its
spatial pattern, and re-growth. We pose two questions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1.</b> Are the inter-annual dynamics and rates of deforestation and abandonment to
    secondary forest significantly different than the decadal mean values in Amazonia, and can
    this account for a dampening of the biogenic source of carbon apparent in annual
    observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen?<br>
    <b>2.</b> Through the integration of socioeconomic and satellite data and the development of
    dynamic deforestation models, can we improve our understanding of the dynamics of
    deforestation and the various controls on rates of deforestation and re-growth? </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>To answer these questions we will measure inter-annual rates of deforestation and
re-growth for the whole basin using stratified sampling methods with Landsat data. We then
establish intensive case studies using multi-temporal (annual) satellite data at specific
sites to estimate transition dynamics and transition probabilities for secondary growth
turnover in simple LUCC models. Finally we Conduct field-based case study analyses of the
decision-making processes for farmers and other land-managers, using key informant surveys
and models. This is new work, not currently funded by another source, but we collaborate
with other funded projects to meet our objectives. </p>
