<p>Objectives<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p>Moist
tropical forests in Amazonia, Southeast Asia and Mexico are exposed to
increasingly severe and frequent droughts associated with El Niño episodes. The
consequences of these droughts include potentially large effects on forest
metabolism, reproductive biology, tree mortality, biogeochemistry, and forest
flammability. Forests growing on deeply-weathered clay soils are buffered
against the effects of mild droughts by the large amount of water stored in the
rooting profile. Severe droughts deplete deep soil moisture reserves, however,
causing tree water stress that may inhibit photosynthesis, provoke reproductive
failure, and stimulate root growth and leaf turnover at the cost of stem growth.
The drought-stressed forest may therefore be less productive, have lower rates
of evapotranspiration, and, yet, have higher soil nutrient concentrations and
trace gas fluxes resulting from drought-induced root mortality. Drought-provoked
shedding of leaves, and reductions in populations of litter decomposer
organisms, may increase forest susceptibility to fire. With continued drought,
the structural integrity of the forest deteriorates as water-demanding,
sun-exposed trees, and obligate evergreen trees, succumb to the effects of acute
drought stress and die.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p> We
have begun to test these and other hypotheses through a rainfall exclusion
experiment initiated in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. Approximately half of annual
rainfall is excluded from a one-hectare, trenched plot using a system of 6100
plastic panels and gutters in the forest understory. A similar control plot is
trenched, but receives natural rainfall. The rainfall exclusion treatment began
in February of 2000, following a one-year pre-treatment intercalibration period.
We measure canopy photosynthesis, leaf water potential, and phenology from
wooden canopy towers and catwalks. Tree growth, tree mortality, sapflow,
litterfall, LAI, forest floor decomposition, soil respiration, trace gas
emissions, water and nutrient fluxes, and forest floor flammability are measured
in the forest understory. Volumetric soil water and fine root dynamics are
monitored in 12-m-deep soil shafts. The remote sensing of forest drought stress
will be analyzed through comparisons of leaf chemistry and leaf spectral
properties with Hyperion high-resolution satellite imagery. Soil water movement
is studied using deuterium pulses. Models of water flux, ecosystem productivity,
biogeochemical processes, and forest fire prediction will be parameterized for
Amazonia through this experiment. This project will allow us to conduct an
integrated assessment of the effect of a three-year, severe drought on the
structure and function of an Amazon forest, increasing our ability to predict
the ecological consequences of increasingly frequent El Niño episodes.<o:p>

Project Goals &amp; Hypotheses:</p>

<p>We
will test the following predictions about the initial (first 1-2 years) effects
of rainfall exclusion upon an Amazon forest:<o:p>
</o:p>
 </o:p></o:p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in">H1:
a decrease in photosynthetic capacity, leaf water potential, sapflow, specific
leaf&nbsp;&nbsp;
area, leaf chlorophyll, leaf N, P and lignin;<o:p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">H2:
increased leaf shedding and replacement; lower LAI<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">H3:
a decrease in rates of stemwood and root growth and soil respiration, but an
increase in litterfall;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">H4:
a decrease in total nitrogen oxide emissions, and an increase in the ratio of
NO:N2O emissions;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">H5:
a decrease in litter fauna and decomposition rates; and<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">H6:
higher flammability because of greater forest floor mass and drier forest
microclimate<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
We
predict the following responses to the long-term (yrs 2-4) effects of rainfall
exclusion, when plant-available water is depleted:<blockquote>
  <p>H7:
  increased reproductive failure through fruit abortion;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p>H8:
  the forest becomes open and patchy as shade-intolerant, fast-growing canopy
  trees, and shade-tolerant, slow-growing understory trees die; slow-growing,
  shade-tolerant canopy species will best withstand severe drought;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p>H9:
  further decline in NPP, as the forest shifts to drought-tolerant foliage, and
  as trees die;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p>H10:
  fine root production continues at low rates, but the decomposition of roots
  killed by drought increases soil respiration;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p>H11:
  net N mineralization, net nitrification, N oxide emissions, and solutions of
  nutrients increase as fine root biomass with low C: nutrient ratios
  decomposes; <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p>H12:
  a build-up of coarse woody debris on the forest floor, increasing the
  flammability of the forest;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p>H13:
  at very advanced stages when mortality causes large inputs of woody tissues
  with high C: nutrient ratios, the flow of nutrients into the mineral soil
  surface will decline as nutrients are immobilized in an accumulating forest
  floor that is both impoverished in decomposer fauna and contains high lignin
  content, and as fungi translocate nutrients into decomposing woody debris; a
  decrease in N oxide emissions will accompany net N immobilization.<o:p>
