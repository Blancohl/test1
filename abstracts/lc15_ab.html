mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">In
atmospheric boundary layer problems over various landscapes, the fluxes of
sensible heat, latent heat and carbon dioxide are determined in terms of surface
characteristics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the
main parameters used in Global Circulation Models (GCM) or in
soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models is the aerodynamic roughness
length (Z<sub>0</sub>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
parameter is important to determine the vertical gradients of mean wind speed
and the conditions for momentum transfer over a vegetated or bare rough surface.
Over vegetated surfaces, the aerodynamic roughness length has a simple
one-to-one relationship with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">rms </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>height
variation of the vegetation at the top of the canopy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once this roughness length is determined for a surface, it does not
change with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>wind speed, stability
or stress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the ground
measurement of this parameter is difficult, time consuming and expensive,
reliable data on its distribution and quantity over global land cover types,
even at the coarse resolution of GCM models, do not exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a result, even the spatially distributed models use values from very
limited and sparse field measurements reported in the literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this work, we propose to use the SRTM data in conjunction with limited
calibration data from the VCL system to generate a global aerodynamic roughness
parameter at 1 km spatial scale to be used in regional and global scale climate
and land-atmospheric models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
phase and amplitude of the cross correlation of the two complex images obtained
by SRTM is known to be sensitive to surface height which is defined as the
distance between the scattering phase centers and a reference line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even though the estimation of absolute height of vegetation from the data
can be erroneous due to surface variability and the limited penetration of the
signal into the canopy, but the variation of the height can be obtained
accurately. By averaging the estimated values from 30 meter resolution of SRTM
to 1 km pixels, the estimation of the rms height of the surface can be improved
to a centimeter accuracy. An algorithm has been developed to estimate this
parameter from SRTM data at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and has been tested
using the airborne interferometric data (AIRSAR). To improve this algorithm and
validate the estimation of the parameter from the SRTM imagery, the Amazon basin
has been chosen as the primary test site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
will allow the use of field measurements, satellite data, and process models to
test the application of the algorithm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
LBA data sets used for this are: (1) vegetation structure data from various
primary, secondary and woodland sites, (2) tower measurements of aerodynamic
roughness, (3) VCL (Vegetation Canopy Lidar) data of vegetation height from
limited orbital data processed immediately after the mission launch, (4)
airborne laser altimeter data and possible AIRSAR data acquired by the LBA project,
(5) ecosystem/atmospheric process models for sensitivity analysis and
integration of spatial distribution of roughness data over the basin.</span></p>
