Summary</p>
<p>Lidar measurements of vegetated land provide unprecedented
views of the vertical<br>
and horizontal structure of the canopy and the topography beneath. Lidar<br>
provides a unique view of the actual physical surfaces of the ground and canopy<br>
and important biophysical parameters such as biomass can be estimated with<br>
extreme accuracy. By utilizing medium to large diameter laser footprints and<br>
recording the entire time history of interaction between a short pulse of laser<br>
light and the surface of the Earth, we can directly measure the vertical<br>
structure of vegetation including canopy height, a profile of vegetation<br>
material down through the canopy, and sub-canopy topography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For this effort we<br>
propose to utilize an existing research-level airborne remote sensing laser<br>
altimeter (the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor - LVIS), enhance its associated<br>
processing software, and collect data over areas totaling 15,000 km2 (assuming a<br>
2 km LVIS swath and no cloud returns). We will produce direct measurements of<br>
vegetation height and topography, as well as produce estimates of above-ground<br>
biomass for the mapped regions.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>These data act as a link between small area<br>
ground sites and large area mapping by satellite sensors allowing calibration of<br>
satellite sensors to be linked to small study areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Work included in this<br>
proposal is as follows: enhance data processing system to automatically produce<br>
validated, high-quality laser altimeter data sets, ready the LVIS instrument for<br>
deployment to Amazonia, collect 5,000 km2 of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>LVIS data over three LBA study<br>
areas (Santarem, Manaus and Rondonia) and an additional 10,000 km2 along the two<br>
LBA transacts in two campaigns (wet and dry seasons), produce validated data<br>
products of vegetation height and topography, and collaborate with other<br>
investigators to estimate above-ground biomass for the entire laser mapped<br>
region. Further, we will compare LVIS and SRTM data products to assess the<br>
errors in the SRTM DEM and to validate the utility of calibrating the SRTM data<br>
to potentially produce &quot;bare earth&quot; topography and vegetation height
estimates<br>
in areas not coincidently sampled with SAR and lidar. A subset of the processed<br>
lidar data (canopy height, topography and various parameters describing the<br>
waveform), gridded maps of canopy height and topography, and &quot;bare
earth&quot; SRTM<br>
product will be publicly distributed as part of the LBA-DIS. Recorded lidar<br>
waveform data for selected investigator sites only will be available through the<br>
LBA-DIS. This is because of the large amount of data storage required to keep<br>
this data on-line. It is expected that the full lidar data record (that is the<br>
topography, canopy height and waveform data on a shot by shot basis) will be<br>
distributed through the Eros Data Center (EDC) as part of the VCL data<br>
distribution.
