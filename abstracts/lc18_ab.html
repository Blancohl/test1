<p>Science Questions</p>

<p>A.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>LC-Q3&nbsp; What is the area
of forest that is affected by selective logging each year?&nbsp; How does the intensity of selective logging
influence forest ecosystem function, thus altering forest regrowth and
flammability?</p>

<p>B.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>LC-Q1&nbsp; What are the
rates and mechanisms of forest conversion to agricultural land uses, and what
is the relative importance of these land uses?</p>

<p>Research Approach</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in">Our proposal focuses on the
detection of canopy structural, biophysical and biochemical changes of selective
logging using hyperspectral optical remote sensing data.&nbsp; The optical data respond primarily to
chemical and structural changes in forest canopies from both natural and human
sources of variability.&nbsp; Our ongoing
field work characterizing chronosequences of selective logging intensity and
regrowth in the eastern Amazon will establish the chemical and structural
effects, which will be remotely sensed with the airborne AVIRIS imaging
spectrometer.&nbsp; These chemical and
structural effects resulting from selective logging will need to be separated
from background phenological effects.&nbsp;
The goals, or final products, of this proposal are: 1) identification of
selective-logging events, 2) quantification of canopy damage, 3)
characterization and separation of phenological signatures, 4) demonstration of
approaches for scaling up the airborne results to TERRA ASTER, EO-1 Hyperion,
and Landsat ETM+, and 5) develop substantial education and inter-agency
training on the use of remote sensing for forestry applications.&nbsp; The science goals require quantitative
estimates of three biochemical and structural remote-sensing products.&nbsp; From the hyperspectral optical data, we will
estimate 1) sub-pixel exposed cover of green canopy, non-photosynthetic
vegetation (NPV), soil, and deep shadow, 2) canopy leaf area index (LAI) and
relative water content, and 3) upper canopy pigment concentration.</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in">We predict that each stage in the
selective logging chronosequence &#150; from primary forest to the logging event to
regrowth &#150; has distinct hyperspectral signatures.&nbsp; A chemical-physical photon transport model will be used to
analyze the hyperspectral data.&nbsp; Fazenda
Cauaxi, Floresta Nacional de Tapajos, and Fazenda Fortaleza (spread across the
state of Para) are the primary study sites at which our chronosequences have
been and will continue to be characterized.&nbsp;
The field effort includes rotational surveys of canopy damage, wood
volume and biomass removal, and regrowth as well as intensive campaigns (during
aircraft overflights) to measure canopy biophysics, biochemistry and structure,
and atmospheric properties.&nbsp; AVIRIS will
be flown over these sites in the beginning (July) and end (Nov) of the dry
season.&nbsp; We propose that hyperspectral
remote sensing will greatly enhance the reliability and accuracy of selective
logging detection, measurement of selective logging intensity (e.g. via
structural damage), and regrowth.&nbsp; This
information is critically needed to assess the impacts of selective logging,
which is pertinent to forest management and carbon cycle research.</p>
