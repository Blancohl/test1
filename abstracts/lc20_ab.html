    <p>Summary</p>
  <p>Remote sensing is a critical component of LBA
    ecology, contributing to the basin wide study primarily through land-cover
    classification, land-cover change, and biophysical retrievals. Accurate maps of
    land-cover, land cover change and canopy biophysical properties are needed as
    inputs for hydrological and biogeochemical models, as a means for quantifying
    above ground carbon stocks, scaling up flux tower measurements beyond tower
    sites and to direct field sampling.&nbsp; Currently a wide array of
    spaceborne image data are available to the project including multitemporal Landsat TM,
    AVHRR, some SAR and more recently, MODIS, SeaWiFS, Ikonos and ASTER. While many
    of these data sets are invaluable, they do not have the capability of
    separating many important land-cover classes, nor the capability of more accurate
    biophysical retrievals offered by hyperspectral systems. Examples of
    land-cover classes that cannot be distinguished reliably with image data available to the
    project include green pasture, early regeneration and tree crops. Past
    research in Eastern Amazonia, and more current research in Rondonia has shown that
    some of these ambiguities are non trivial. For example, in the vicinity of Ji
    Parana, spectral ambiguity between green pasture and second growth forest results
    in interannual fluctuations between these two cover classes of up to
    10%, with the highest proportion of second growth occuring in early dry
    season images.&nbsp; No such ambiguity will occur in hyperspectral data. Tree crops,
    which cannot be separated from some second growth forests without
    extensive supporting field data, should also be spectrally distinct in
    hyperspectral data. Improved biophysical retrievals include LAI retrievals for
    forested areas at ranges that typically saturate NDVI. &nbsp;LBA ecology is also limited by the availability
    of high quality spectral reflectance data at branch to canopy scales. In order
    to best interpret canopy reflectance, it is critical that data exist at an
    appropriate spatial scale for remotely sensed data. Because of the difficulty of
    acquiring a sufficient number of spectra from towers, an airborne campaign is
    virtually the only way to develop such a library. Not only can such a library
    improve the quality of land-cover maps, but it can be convolved to other
    sensors, and thereby used to improve analysis using broad band systems that cover a
    larger area and include archived data sets. &nbsp;For this research, we propose to address a number
    of critical problems in land-cover mapping and biophysical retrievals through
    the use of high resolution AVIRIS. We propose a 4 to 8 week deployment,
    starting in late June/early July, at the start of the dry season and
    prior to the onset of significant burning. We propose target sites in
    Rondonia that include well characterized sites such as Fazenda Nova Vida, tower
    sites such as Jaru, and a selection of targets that cover a range of land-cover
    categories (crop, pastures of ranging quality, second growth at different
    ages and primary forest). Site selection would be guided by extensive
    GIS layers and Landsat time series we have developed for the state of Rondonia.
    A key focus will be on well characterized sites. Expected products include a
    regionally specific spectral library for Rondonia that includes all major
    dominant cover types, land-cover maps using techniques developed at UCSB, and
    new biophysical maps such as LAI retrievals. UCSB will work closely with
    Brazilian collaborators and other LBA researchers to develop optimal test sites
    throughout the state. This project contributes to LBA educational initiatives
    through graduate student support of a Brazilian PhD and a remote sensing short
    course on hyperspectral remote sensing, to be taught in Rondonia and
    potentially at INPE. &nbsp; <span style="font-family:Courier">&nbsp;</span>
