<p>Summary</p>

<p>We will integrate remote sensing, GIS and field sampling of soil and vegetation to
develop predictive models relating land cover change to its effect on nutrient cycling
along the environmental gradients proposed as LBA transects. We predict that differences
in substrate composition and environment will drive distinctly different rates of
regeneration and affect the duration of pasture use, thus requiring different approaches
for sustainable management. We will conduct time-series analysis of land-cover change
using Landsat MSS and TM combined with radar to enhance discrimination of pasture and
early stages of forest regeneration. Our initial focus will be in Rondonia and Marabá,
where historical satellite data have been assembled and analyzed, and where a large body
of process level soils and vegetation data already exist. Site selection for soil
biogeochemical sampling will be driven by explicit, rule-driven mapping of terrain
attributes (initially from digitized topographic maps) and land-cover/land-use maps
derived from remote sensing. Soils and vegetation will be sampled for laboratory analysis
of cations, exchange properties, carbon, nitrogen, bulk density, wet chemical extraction
of P from different pools, and possibly <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr isotopic ratios
for nutrient provenance. We will develop mechanistic models that relate soil nutrient
composition and dynamics to soil. At each sampling locality the effect of land cover
conversion and subsequent management will be documented by analysis of N, P , mineral
composition and cation pools existing in soils on comparable landforms. Analyzed along the
transects, these data will allow development of a mass balance understanding of
weathering, mineral transformation and the nutrient supplying status of Amazon basin
ecosystems as affected by environment and substrate.</p>

<p>Our long-term objective is to develop empirical/predictive biogeochemical models with a
focus on nutrient dynamics linked to environmental gradients and land cover change. We
will predict and test our models using current/future remotely sensed data sets. These
models and observations will be critical to understanding ecosystem dynamics as influenced
by land-use decisions and should contribute to sustainable management practices in the
region. Our research will contribute directly to the larger LBA objectives and will be
informed by results from other team members. </p>

<p>General Strategy</p>

<p>We will be operating over a cascading hierarchy of scales. The broadest scale being the
Amazon basin which will be segmented by the LBA transect structure. The next scale will
focus on the region around the intensively studied tower sites, which we expect will be
underlain by a specific geologic formation. Within the intensive study sites we will
conduct further stratification by two methods. First, we will use digital topography data
to calculate terrain attributes that will allow us to segment the study sites into
landforms and landform elements that are grouped according to similar statistical and
physiographic properties. At the most detailed level of separation (in this case,
determined by data resolution), we will develop variograms to determine the spacing
required for collection of uncorrelated samples. We will then be able to collect random
samples at that level. This explicit, statistically based sampling scheme allow upward
scaling of results based on topography which is extremely important but we will have to
overcome data limitation problems through digitization of paper maps until topographic
data are generated by airborne campaigns or satellite. Second, we will develop land cover
maps and land use history maps using remote sensing data. Our remote sensing strategy is
to build on our preexisting experience mapping land-cover and land-cover change in Manaus
and Maraba to extend these capabilities to Rondonia and other regions along the transect.
We have already assembled all of the necessary optical data for Rondonia and some SIR-C
data. We will pursue additional radar data, such as JERS-1 data sets being assembled by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for much of the basin. We have already developed the
programs and obtained the computer facilities that will enable us to generate land-cover
and land-use histories rapidly in any region of the basin where data are available. Once
the topographic hierarchy and land cover/land use history maps are completed, we can
compare the two to determine the landscape pattern of land conversion and to ensure that
the sampling scheme adequately covers all land cover types.</p>

<p>We will focus detailed sampling on comparisons among primary forest and various land
cover classes. As other researchers have done, we expect to make intensive use of pasture
chronosequences, which will give us a time history of biogeochemical change. Finally, we
will compare biogeochemical behavior in and between different land cover types across the
LBA transects. We anticipate that as LBA our soil biogeochemistry data will be useful to
plant ecologists and other biogeochemists on the LBA Science Team and expect to adjust
sampling priorities to meet the overall needs of the LBA Team. </p>

<p>Remote Sensing Strategy</p>

<p>The remotely sensed methodologies we will employ build heavily off of seven years of
prior experience working in several areas within the Amazon basin. We will employ spectral
mixture models using reference end-members as described by Adams et al., (1993, 1995) and
Roberts et al., 1997a. Through past research in the area we have already developed a
spectral library that is applicable to much of the basin. Where new leaf level and canopy
level spectra become available they will be incorporated into our existing libraries.</p>

<p>We will use a binary decision tree approach to classify spectral mixture models from
Landsat TM and MSS into at least seven classes, including primary forest, second growth,
pasture, water, construction (roads/urban), recently burned, and cloud/smoke obscured. We
will employ multi-temporal techniques described by Roberts et al, (1997a) to subdivide
pasture and second growth forest into age classes to establish rates of pasture
maintenance and regeneration. Potential for regeneration and sustainable land use will
vary as some function of intensity of pasture use and age. Images will be screened for
clouds using techniques described by Roberts et al. (1997a). Classification errors can be
reduced through use of time series as well. Difficulties will occur in separating green
pastures and some types of agriculture from second growth forest. This problem is expected
to be particularly significant in Rondonia, which has extensive pastures, croplands and
some plantations. To facilitate mapping we will explore use of L band radar, using SIR-C
data where available (such as Rondonia) and JERS-1 in other regions.</p>

<p>If new remotely sensed optical and microwave data sets become available during the
course of LBA we will take advantage of them opportunistically. For example, we have
extensive experience in the analysis of AVIRIS data for mapping vegetation. We have
already obtained and analyzed some AVIRIS data collected in the state of Rondonia during
the SCAR-B program. If enhanced TM or LEWIS HSI data become available we will use them as
part of our strategy for testing predictions for regeneration success and explore their
capabilities for improvements in spectral libraries and vegetation classification. </p>

<p>Landscape Modeling, Site Selection, and Scaling of Results</p>

<p>A suite of Earth processes combine with land use to act as driving variables that
determine the present state of soil biogeochemistry in Amazon ecosystems. The importance
of individual controls is scale dependent. At the physiographic region level, gradients in
climate coupled with underlying geology drive the properties and processes of soils and
ecosystems. Rainfall may be seasonally limiting in parts of Amazonia; at the same time
nutrients may be conserved relative to the wetter regions. The nature of soil parent
material and the depth to fresh rock (containing nutrients) are significant determinants
of biogeochemical functioning. More locally where climate and geology are relatively
uniform, topographic variation controls soil biogeochemical functioning because of
redistribution of water and soluble nutrients along flow paths. Topography modifies Human
land use in predictable ways (i.e. certain landforms will be utilized more than others).
In this proposal we will quantify variations in soil biogeochemistry as affected by
natural and anthropogenic processes acting at these different scales.</p>

<p>The spatial distribution of soil properties (soil-landscape) is part of the overall
ecosystem and is a primary control on nutrient dynamics. A soil-landscape is a complex
geomorphologic, biogeochemical and hydrological system which controls the composition and
productivity of ecosystems and their response to disturbance. The characteristics of the
soil-landscape provide essential information for modeling the pools, pathways and fluxes
of water and nutrients. The key components for determining soil biogeochemical properties
are quantitative spatial models that include, but are not limited to soil properties such
as A-horizon depth, overall soil depth, clay content, cation exchange capacity, organic
matter content, available nutrients, nutrient supplying capacity and bulk density.
Topographic variation within the soil-landscape system modifies ecosystem functioning by
changing fluxes of water, energy and mass. Long-term differences in fluxes can be inferred
from differences in measured soil properties. The spatial distribution of soil properties
drive the location of monitoring sites for short-term ecosystem-specific fluxes within the
soil-landscape system such as water balance and nutrient availability.</p>

<p>Although it is difficult to measure below ground soil-landscape characteristics, we can
develop statistical relationships between soil properties and terrain attributes such as
slope, aspect, hill-slope position, and slope shape. Our approach, developed by Paul
Gessler and others (Gessler et al. 1995, McSweeney et al., 1994, Moore et al., 1993),
integrates a geographic information system (GIS), digital terrain modeling, and
statistical modeling to quantify relationships between soil properties and terrain
attributes, which are calculated from continuous digital elevation models using GIS map
algebra tools. Terrain attributes are inexpensive to map over large areas and
quantitatively describe the distribution of landscape processes (e.g. water flow
convergence/divergence, sediment and solute transport, solar radiation). The distributions
of terrain attributes can be used to design sampling schemes that capture the full range
of landscape variation and to predict soil biogeochemical characteristics. By then
sampling across the range of terrain attributes, we build statistical models relating
landscape structure to soil biogeochemical properties. These models allow explicit
aggregation of point measurement data or simulation model output (based on point source
input data) to landscape scales. </p>

<p>Implementation procedures in Amazonia are as follows: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Work in conjunction with the science team to identify priority physiographic provinces
    to cover a range of climate and substrate. We expect to start in Rondonia as part of the
    mesoscale catchment study and the first tower cluster along western transect </li>
  <li>Develop digital elevation models from various sources: digitized 1:100,000 scale maps
    being competed by Tom Dunne's research team (we expect to digitize maps as well), new
    topographic mapping technology such as TOPSAR, Global Topographic Mapping Mission and
    laser altimetry, and semi-quantitative measures of topographic attributes using remote
    sensing data </li>
  <li>Calculate (Moore et al., 1993) and map (Gessler et al., 1995) terrain attributes that
    are appropriate to particular landscapes (we expect to be hampered the lack of data at
    appropriate scales) </li>
  <li>Use variogram analysis to determine minimum distances between sample sites required for
    random sampling of soil and biogeochemical properties </li>
  <li>Overlay land use and land cover classes on the terrain attributes to determine
    preferential locations of land cover change </li>
  <li>Modify topographically driven soil biogeochemistry sampling plan to ensure that all land
    cover types are represented. </li>
</ol>

<p>Soil Biogeochemical Sampling and Analysis</p>

<p>At each site we will characterize the weathering and nutrient status of soils by
sampling 3 detailed profiles further augmented by randomly distributed core samples to
document soil variability. Core sample site selection will be driven by the statistical
analysis of digital elevation models described above. Soil profiles will be described
according to USDA specifications (Soil Survey Staff, 1992). Channel samples of each
horizon will be taken for analysis of total elements, mineral composition, bulk density,
pH, exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, cations in soil solution, phosphorous,
carbon, and nitrogen.</p>

<p>Weathering and elemental losses from soils will be studied. Soil weathering leads to
significant leaching losses of the soil-derived nutrient elements (K, Ca, Mg, P), Si, and
even Al. It is critical to document the weathering state of the different substrates
because it is indicative of the nutrient reserve for the ecosystem. The amount of
elemental loss relative to the parent material provides a measure of the weathering state
of a soil profile and its present nutrient supplying capacity. Recent development of
physio-chemical strain gauge based on mass balance allows the use of accumulated strain to
calculate chemical gains and losses (Chadwick et al., 1990). An immobile element, i, (e.g.
Zr) is used to compute the change in volume during pedogenesis as follows: </p>

<p>         i,w = (pCi,p/wCi,w) - 1                   (1)       </p>

<p>Where is dry bulk density (g cm<sup>-3</sup>), C is element mass (wt. %), w is
weathered horizon, and p is parent material. Negative values represent collapse of the
profile. Once the bulk strain is computed, chemical mass gains and losses of a mobile
element, j, per unit volume of parent material, j,w (g cm<sup>-3</sup>) are calculated
with eq. 2: </p>

<p>         j,w = (wCj,w(i,w + 1) - pCj,p)/100.       (2)       </p>

<p>Elemental analyses will be made by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry on fused or
acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, &amp; HF) dissolved soil material for
all major rock forming elements.</p>

<p>Nutrient and mineralogical distribution within soils. In addition to the total mass of
elements, selective wet chemical extractions are used to document the form that an element
is in: exchangeable, organically bound, bound in secondary minerals, bound in primary
minerals. Exchange bases are determined using NH<sub>4</sub>OAC extraction, exchange Al by
KCl extraction and exchange capacity by the sum of bases and Al (Soil Survey Staff, 1992).
Soil organic C and N will be determined using a Carlo Erba CNS analyzer; Standard
procedures will be used for bulk density and pH (Soil Survey Staff, 1992).</p>

<p>The quantity, chemical forms, and availability of soil phosphorus are particularly
important. The dominant forms of phosphorus vary systematically with soil mineralogical
and chemical properties (Walker and Syers, 1976; Cole and Heil, 1981; Schimel et al.,
1985; Smeck, 1985, Cross and Schlesinger, 1995). That variation often regulates carbon and
nitrogen dynamics in the long term. We propose to evaluate the forms of soil P using
Tiessen and Mohr's (1993) modification of the Hedley et al. (1982) sequential extraction
procedure. This procedure yields P fractions that are operationally defined, but
experience has shown that they correlate quite well with Walker and Syers (1976)
conceptually defined pools of P (Crews et al., 1995).</p>

<p>Mineral composition which controls cation exchange capacity and P sorption properties
will be determined using X-Ray Diffraction, and for selected samples, a series of
sequential extractions (Chadwick et al., 1990; Chadwick et al., 1994). For each of these
samples, gravimetric weight loss is measured after each treatment. Selective dissolution
procedures are as follows: </p>

<ol>
  <li>removal of organo-metal complex with peroxide (Wada, 1989) </li>
  <li>removal of non-crystalline allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite using acid ammonium
    oxalate in the dark (McKeague and Day, 1966) </li>
  <li>removal of crystalline goethite and hematite by Na-dithionite and Na-citrate using the
    Blakemore and others (1987) modification of Holmgren (1967) procedure </li>
  <li>removal of the poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and gibbsite using (Jackson and
    others, 1986) </li>
  <li>removal of kaolin by heating the residue to 500 °C followed by a 0.5 M NaOH extraction.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quantification of nutrient provenance is important to understand biogeochemical
dynamics. Strontium isotopes can be used to determine the provenance of calcium and
quantify the relative amounts contributed by silicate weathering and atmospheric dust and
rain (Capo et al., in press; Stewart et al., in press; Graustein, 1989). In order to
interpret <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr values, clear differences must exist between the
<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr values of soil parent material and atmospheric input. At
this time we do not know if we can apply the technique uniformly across Amazonia. As part
of this project we will collect preliminary samples for analysis and if warranted we will
propose a parallel study designed to identify the nature of nutrient recharge to the
Amazon ecosystems.</p>

<p><i>Plant and Litter Nutrients.</i> The nutrient status of plants and the distribution
of species in a landscape provide a natural measure of the nutrient supplying capability
of the soil where they are growing. The youngest fully-expanded stem of mature, sun leaves
will be analyzed for leaf mass per area, N, P, base cations, Fe and Al. We will measure N
mineralization using intact core incubations and N and P availability using resin bags. We
anticipate that leaves taken from trees growing on from nutrient rich soils will have
enhanced P concentrations compared with leaves from nutrient poor soils. This approach is
not without problems - element storage within vegetation and dilution of element
concentrations by growth as well as soil nutrient availability affect foliar
concentrations (Chapin et al., 1990).</p>

<p>The selection of measurements is based on data required to develop mechanistic models
of soil biogeochemical processes. We have over 20 years of experience interpreting the
processes that lead to measured properties. Although developing mechanistic models is our
major focus, a subset of these data can also be used as input to ecosystem simulation
models such as CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988). We can run CENTURY simulations to compare
with our mechanistic understanding and contribute the edaphic input parameters to other
members of the LBA Science Team. </p>
