<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The objectives of the proposed research are to define and describe the types of
landscapes that fall under the broad category of &quot;degraded lands,&quot; and to study
biogeochemical cycles across a range of degradation found in secondary forests and cattle
pastures of Amazonia. Half of the 10-20 million hectares of Amazonian forest converted to
cattle pasture are thought to be &quot;in an advanced state of degradation,&quot; but
&quot;degraded&quot; means different things to different people. Degrees of degradation
are poorly defined and quantified, and yet are important with respect to future land-use
options and current rates of C sequestration, trace gas emissions, and water use. We
define degraded land as that which has lost part of its capacity to support plant
productivity, either in the context of agro-ecosystems or as communities of native
vegetation. We propose a suite of biogeochemical measurements that may be used as indices
of degradation. Organized according to the LBA themes, these include: </p>
<b>

<p>CARBON STORAGE AND EXCHANGE:</b> We propose to measure productivity (as rates of above
ground biomass accumulation), soil respiration, radiocarbon content of soil CO<sub>2</sub>
and of soil organic matter (in collaboration with Susan Trumbore) in a range of degraded
lands. We will also measure associated diversity of species of plants and soil fauna. </p>
<b>

<p>NUTRIENT DYNAMICS:</b> We will measure net N mineralization, net nitrification, stocks
of N, P, and cations in soils and vegetation, fluxes of nutrients in precipitation,
throughfall, soil solutions, and stream-water, and activity of soil fauna. We also have
proposed a fertilizer experiment in capoeiras to test whether nutrients limit rates of
growth of secondary vegetation. </p>
<b>

<p>TRACE GAS FLUXES:</b> In addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, we will measure emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O,
NO, and CH<sub>4</sub>. </p>
<b>

<p>LAND USE/LAND COVER:</b> We also proposed transects of videography using low flying
aircraft to improve classification of subclasses of degraded lands and to estimate their
relative aerial importance within Landsat TM scenes. Spectral properties of high
resolution images will be used to estimate the percentages of vegetation cover and visible
bare soils, vegetation index, brightness, greenness, and wetness/shadow components of the
land cover. These estimates will be compared to our field data to determine if indices of
degradation deduced from image analyses agree with field measurements of biogeochemical
processes.</p>

<p>Because the complexity of interactions among land-use histories, soils, and climate
makes extrapolation from a few secondary forest tower sites precarious, our proposed
studies at numerous secondary forest sites are necessary to capture the range of rates of
biogeochemical cycling processes found within the broad class of degraded lands. Our
results will be relevant to biogeochemical constraints of sustainable local land
management and will be necessary for regional scale models and budgets of carbon and trace
gases. </p>
