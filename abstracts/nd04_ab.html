<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We propose studies in three theme areas of LBA: carbon storage; nutrient dynamics; and
trace gas fluxes. Training of Brazilian collaborators and graduate students is an
important goal. We propose to evaluate soil biogeochemical processes on degraded pastures
and in six-year-old agro-silvopastoral systems at the EMBRAPA-CPAA experiment site located
54 km from Manaus on BR 174 and adjacent to the primary forest site used by INPA. The
degraded pastures are on the widely distributed clayey Oxisol (clayey, kaolinitic,
isohyperthermic, Xanthic Hapludox). </p>

<b>

<p>Carbon Stocks.</b> Our preliminary data from recent work in the Amazon show dramatic
increases in biomass accumulation in both native and exotic tree and grass species with
modest additions of P and Ca to soils. To assess these priming effects of nutrients, we
will measure total system carbon (woody biomass, understory herbaceous biomass, litter
fall, surface litter, roots, fine root dynamics and soil) in fertilized and non fertilized
pasture chronosequence (2 years to 25 years). Similar measurements will be done in four,
well-characterized six-year-old agro-silvopastoral (ASP) systems that were established on
degraded pastures. Analyses of C stocks and pools will provide us with data for predictive
models of vegetation regrowth and carbon dynamics as a function of management
interventions.</p>

<b>

<p>Nutrient Dynamics.</b> We will measure nutrient stocks and cycling and water dynamics
in both the fertilized and non-fertilized pasture chronosequence and ASP systems. Although
the focus of the study will be on P and Ca as major limiting nutrients, the need for
nutrient additions will be based on analysis of soil nutrient levels and nutrient
availability, coupled with yield projections and nutrient budgets for the systems. We will
also measure (a) soil moisture and surface temperature and the resulting soil fauna
(decomposer) populations, (b) chemical characteristics (lignin, cellulose, polyphenols,
and other nutrients) of the litter, and (c) litter decomposition and nutrient release
patterns in the fertilized and non fertilized pasture and ASP systems. We expect to obtain
a better understanding of the response of the various components of the decomposers to
changes in microclimate, litter quality, and soil nutrient status and thus improve our
ability to predict rates of decomposition and hence nutrient release patterns in different
pasture and ASP use scenarios. </p>

<p>Our measurements of above and below-ground productivity linked to the physical,
chemical and biological factors will provide information on processes controlling carbon
and nutrient dynamics in abandoned pastures and the management alternatives to
rehabilitate abandoned pasture land. The detailed characterization of the soils,
vegetation, management and environmental variables at our site will facilitate
extrapolation of the results to other sites. </p>
