<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The principal objectives of this proposal are to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Review and synthesize previous research that has examined nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
    (P) pools and cycling patterns in Amazonian forests and cerrado,</li>
  <li>Review and synthesize previous research addressing changes in N and P dynamics caused by
    conversion of forest and cerrado to other land-uses (e.g., pasture, secondary forest after
    logging, agroforestry systems, and tree plantations), and</li>
  <li>Outline gaps in present knowledge and suggest future research directions in this area.
    Over the past thirty years, road building and government-backed colonization schemes in
    the Amazon Basin have resulted in increases in human population and rising pressures on
    natural resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Concurrent with this modern colonization of the Amazon has been a growing body of
knowledge about nutrient dynamics in Amazonian forests and the affects of forest
conversion on nutrient storage and cycling. As this body of literature has expanded, it is
clear that the compilation and synthesis of results from these studies is essential to
provide researchers and research managers with a concise reference to previous work (much
of which is available only in Portuguese), identify gaps in knowledge and potential future
research directions, as well as provide policy makers, landowners and land managers with
information pertinent to the ecological effects of land use changes in the region.<br>
</p>

<p>Continuing conversion of forests to other land uses in the Amazon Basin is inevitable,
especially in areas that are close to major rivers, highways, or cities. Therefore, it is
essential to address the long-term impacts of forest conversion on nutrient pools and
cycling rates and patterns to better understand the limits to productivity once forest
cover has been removed. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two elements of particular
importance, particularly since their availability for plant uptake are thought to limit
primary production (or carbon [C] fixation rates) of ecosystems based on the highly
weathered Oxisol and Ultisol soils which cover the majority of the Amazon Basin. <br>
</p>

<p>We propose to produce at least one co-authored review paper suitable for publication in
the journal Ecological Applications; it is not yet clear whether more than one publication
will be warranted, although the three project objectives are suitable to this if the
volume of the synthesis in the three sub-areas is sufficient. The publication(s) will also
be produced in Portuguese for dissemination and use in Brazilian institutions. In
addition, we will publish the results, in part or in whole, in NASA/LBA proceedings as
appropriate and contribute the results to the NASA/LBA database (LBA-ECO DIS). </p>

<p>Research Team</p>

<p>This literature review and analysis will be conducted through an international
collaboration with researchers from institutions in the U.S., Brazil, and Canada. The
three investigators of this project collectively have literature available from a wide
range of sources and countries and in several languages. The investigators worked together
from 1993-1996 at the Curuá-Una Research Station (100 km east of Santarém, Pará) in a
project that examined plant-induced changes of soil nutrient dynamics under native forest
and tree plantations under a USDA competitive grant. The proposed project is designed to
be completed within one year. </p>
