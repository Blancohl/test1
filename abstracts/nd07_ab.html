<p>Objectives</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proposed studies will focus on the effects of fire and land use change on the
  composition and persistence of litter and soil organic carbon and nitrogen and related
  changes in the soil-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide,
  and nitric oxide. The studies are proposed for a range of cerrado types and agroecosystems
  in the area surrounding Brasilia. We will quantify rates of carbon and nutrient cycling
  and characterize SOM at sites ranging from undisturbed cerrado to burned cerrado to
  agroecosystems. These experiments will include measurements of the carbon and nitrogen
  content and stable isotope ratios of the litter and SOM isolated by size and physical
  fractionation. The lignin content and concentrations of UV-absorbing compounds of the
  litter will also be measured. To determine the size and diversity of the soil microbial
  community at the sites, we will measure the amount and composition of biomarker compounds
  in the litter and SOM, particularly phosopholipid ester-linked fatty acids (PLFA) and
  ergosterol. For ecosystems that have undergone a vegetation change (e.g., from C<sub>3</sub>
  dominated closed canopy cerrado to C<sub>4</sub> pasture) we will measure the carbon
  isotopic composition of individual PLFAs to indicate the source(s) of carbon being
  actively metabolized by the microbial community. To provide data and relationships needed
  for regional trace gas models, we will measure soil-atmosphere fluxes of trace carbon and
  nitrogen gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, N<sub>2</sub>O NO) under various natural (e.g. along
  transects) and manipulated conditions. Ancillary data relevant to these studies will also
  be obtained, including changes in soil temperature, moisture, and incident solar radiation
  that accompany land use change and subsequent agricultural uses of the cleared land.
  Limited manipulations will be conducted during the dry season at the cl<a href="nd07_ab.html">Zepp Group Abstract</a>eared sites, e.g.
  pasture, to measure the effects of solar UV-B exclusion on fluxes of the trace gases from
  the surface litter and dead grasses. </p>
