<p>This project began prior to the LBA call for proposals, and is funded by NASA's New
Investigator Program. Thus, this abstract will be slightly different than most of the
others in that we will briefly outline relevant work already accomplished as well as list
our future plans. The majority of our work is in the Santarem/Tapajos region (lat/long:
3S, 56W).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="4"><b>Project Goals</b></font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;The overall objectives of this project can be divided into three main areas: </p>

<p>&nbsp;1) Process-level measurements of biogeochemical patterns following conversion of
moist tropical forest to pasture, with an emphasis on changes in P, Ca, Mg, K and their
effects on C and N cycles. This work is being done along two pasture-age gradients south
of Santarem; one on high clay soils (avg. 54% clay), and one on extremely sandy soils
(avg. 92% sand).</p>

<p>&nbsp;2) Remote sensing- Biogeochemistry links, including (a) regionalization of
pasture biogeochemical information using high-spatial resolution Landsat TM data and a
radiative transfer inverse modeling technique, (b) analysis of seasonal trends in pasture
vs. forest canopy greenness and energy absorption using an AVHRR spectral unmixing method,
and (c) analysis of the biotic response of the uncleared areas of the Amazon Basin to
inter-annual climate variability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;3) Estimates of how tropical land conversion affects the use of atmospheric <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
data as a tracer of regional fluxes in the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="4">Brief Synopsis of Progress to Date</p>
</font>

<p>As mentioned above, we are focusing on the Santarem region, where we have established
several sites that comprise pasture age gradients (2-15 years old) on two soil types (sand
and clay). Data from these sites show a suite of biogeochemical changes as pastures age,
including substantial losses of soil organic matter, N, P, Ca, Mg and K. In addition,
while both soils demonstrate these declines, there are significant differences at every
pasture age between the soil types. Preliminary foliar data from pasture grasses suggest
that the strongest increases in nutrient limitation are in N, P and Ca. </p>

<p>Early results from radiative transfer (RT) model inversions using both field-collected
spectral data and satellite optical data suggest that changes in productivity (NPP) and
biomass which accompany changes in biogeochemistry can be resolved at regional scales
using satellite data, thereby allowing much more meaningful spatial and temporal analyses
of land use effects on carbon and nutrient cycles than can be approached using standard
remote sensing classification or ground techniques alone. We are also finishing a
basin-level analysis of inter-annual variability in NPP, linked to precipitation anomalies
associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These results show significant
inter-annual variability of Amazon moist forest physiology and carbon uptake which, when
combined with carbon efflux data from land cover / land use change analyses by other
groups, may change our perspective on spatial and temporal variation in sources and sinks
of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>Finally, we have used data and modeled simulations of changes in <sup>13</sup>C of
respired CO<sub>2 </sub>following deforestation, along with continental-scale databases of
land cover change for the last 30 years (eg. Houghton's data), to estimate the current
imbalance in atmosphere-biosphere exchange of <sup>13</sup>C that is due to tropical land
conversion. We have then made preliminary calculations of how this imbalance, or
&quot;dis-equilibrium&quot;, affects atmospheric <sup>13</sup>C-based estimates of global
terrestrial vs. oceanic net fluxes of CO<sub>2 </sub>(cf. Ciais et al 1995, Francey et al.
1995). Our preliminary results suggest that this land-use dis-equilibrium must be taken
into account, as incorporation of our estimate into the Francey et al (1995) analysis
changed their partitioning of terrestrial vs. oceanic exchange by an average of 0.65
GtC/yr. This change manifests itself primarily as an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by
terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="4">Current Activities (spring 98)</p>
</font>

<p>&nbsp;1) Continued work on the biogeochemistry of our pasture sites, including
Hedley-style fractionations of soil P, potential N mineralization, and foliar lignin
analyses.</p>

<p>2) RT inversions of TM data to see if the limited spectral information in the latter
can still provide information on changes in biomass and NPP with pasture age</p>

<p>3) Regional estimates of pasture LAI and NPP at TM scale-resolution for the
Santarem/Tapajos region</p>

<p>Future Plans (summer 98 - spring 00)</p>
</font>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Pasture Biogeochemistry:</strong></p>

<p>We are planning at least 3 more trips to the Tapajos sites; these trips will be timed
so that we can collect data in both dry and wet seasons. We plan to supplement the data we
have on soil and foliar C, N, P and base cation content with repeated measurements of
several more dynamic variables, including using ion exchange resin bags to measure
availability of N, P and base cations in both wet and dry seasons in all pasture sites. We
will also measure dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) in soil solution
in both wet and dry seasons, and plan to install several Prenart tension lysimeters in a
subset of the pastures as a pilot experiment to look at leachate losses of all the above
elements. In addition, we are planning a series of small-scale fertilization experiments
in forest and pasture sites to investigate microbial nutrient limitation. Finally, we are
planning a number of isotopic measurements aimed at understanding rates of organic matter
turnover and loss in these pastures. In collaboration with Jason Neff (Stanford Univ.), we
will measure <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C of bulk soil carbon, fractionated SOM, soil
CO<sub>2</sub>, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forests and pastures on both soil
types. We will also repeat the foliar analyses we've already done in the wet season, and
will measure aboveground biomass of pasture grasses in both wet and dry seasons. </p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Remote Sensing:</strong></p>

<p>In addition to continued work on the projects outlined above, we are actively planning
to use MODIS, MISR and ASTER data when it becomes available in 1999. We intend to
spectrally unmix the MODIS data to recover pasture and forest reflectance signatures. Due
to the daily 1km-resolution coverage of MODIS, we think that the analyses of land-cover
phenology and NPP will be greatly improved using this instrument. MISR data will aid in
determining the degree of aerosol and water vapor contamination which has been a constant
problem with the currently available AVHRR data. Using both MODIS and MISR, we will
improve estimates of greenness, canopy energy absorption, and NPP. Concurrent AVHRR data
may also allow for retrocalibration of at least the more recent AVHRR data.</p>

<p>ASTER data will be used in conjunction with Landsat 7 data to continue the inverse
modeling--biogeochemistry effort. Both of these datasets will be critical for spectral
unmixing of the MODIS data. Unmixed MODIS data also has the potential to be used for RT
inverse modeling, particularly due to its SWIR (1300-2500 nm) spectral coverage (Asner et
al. in review). The SWIR range contains significant information on bare soil extent and
canopy litter fraction (Asner 1998), and we are working as part of the Schimel EOS IDS
group to develop the algorithms needed to retrieve critical pasture canopy characteristics
using unmixed MODIS data.<br>
