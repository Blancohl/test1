<p>Hypotheses and Cautions</p>

<p>We assert several points about the atmospheric environment of LBA-ECO, which appear
reasonable. Only newly funded work under LBA-ECO will allow us to test these and to
aid the ecological community with their interpretation of atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>,
CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>0, and aerosols, as well as assessments of carbon loss
from Amazônia. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The atmospheric environment of the LBAE study area will be affected by inflow of
    outside air in the lower troposphere, and the inflow will be greatest during the rainiest
    seasons. These will at least dilute the concentrations of trace species like nitrous
    oxide, methane, isoprene carbon monoxide natural particulate matter, etc. The rainy season
    period will also be the period of the most dramatic vertical stirring, e.g., by cloud
    downdrafts, with similar effects. See also the MTPE proposal, attached, especially the
    front page, showing strong effects even during the dry season. </p>
    <p>2. Composition of the inflow air is complex. For example, in March and April, there is
    inflow of air from clean ocean regions to portions of Amazônia. However, significant
    inflow from northernmost South America and the Caribbean, and also more southern regions
    of South America occurs. All these regions have burning or industrial pollution during
    these times. The largest potential inflow of complex, polluted, air is, however, from
    nearby subSaharan Africa, which is at the height of its burning season. As the preliminary
    work of the citation indicates, these effects may be sporadic and poorly quantified at
    this point, but are not to be neglected. </p>
    <p>3. The loss of isoprene and other organics from the Amazônian system provides a gross
    loss of C from the system, 1.5% to 4% of NPP. Such percentage affects the perception of an
    agrading ecosystem when periods of 25 to 100 years are considered. CO may constitute 15%
    to 60% of the &quot;final&quot; products of isoprene oxidation; here, final means that the
    material can escape the Amazônian region. Other species may rapidly stick to surfaces or
    be rained out, possibly somewhat downwind. Measurements of CO and organic trace gases in
    CLAIRE and organic aerosols and condensibles by Paulo Artaxo at various times will inform
    our estimates of C loss from Amazônia. </p>

<p>Abstract of Proposed Work</p>

<p>We propose to: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Compare and improve simulations of the chemical composition of the troposphere over
    Amazônia as made by American and Brazilian scientists using meteorological mesoscale and
    larger scale models. USP and Ames scientist have selected past periods of intensive
    measurement for intercomparison (e.g.. SCARB and ABLE periods). One focus of this work is
    to compare quantitatively the effects of parameterizations of planetary boundary layer and
    cloud venting. </p>
    <p>2. Allow inferences of the perturbation of the Amazônia lowermost troposphere by
    outside influences. We will use incisive tracer simulations to highlight expected
    perturbations on methane, nitrous oxide. Since effects on these long-lived species will be
    small, and small concentration differences due to transport may nevertheless be used to
    infer large effects, we will also simulate carbon monoxide, smoke aerosol mass, and
    perhaps NO / N0<sub>2</sub>. In addition to the climatic interest in these species, they
    highlight exchange processes in great detail, and some of these species may be remotely
    sensed. </p>
    <p>3. As measurements accumulate during the LBA period, we expect we can start studies
    describing the role of isoprene, other non-methane arboreal emissions, and their products
    on the carbon balance of Amazônia. These studies serve two purposes: they help define the
    CO export from that rainforest region to the world during seasons of low worldwide
    burning, and they affect the Amazônian C and N budgets at a significant level. This level
    of funding does not allow chemical mechanistic studies of isoprene's return to the
    ecosystem, but it does allow: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial studies of the isoprene profiles and concentrations using planetary boundary
        layer 1d models and thus some information on the isoprene flux from a forest and the
        location of the &quot;stickiest&quot; gases and aerosols relative to forest surfaces.</li>
      <li>Large-scale studies of carbon flux from the Amazon based on estimated conversion
        efficiencies to CO, generically &quot;sticky&quot; organics, or aerosols.</li>
      <li> Comparisons of observations and measurements will occupy later years of the
        proposal. Any students involved will need to familiarize themselves with the modeling and
        chemistry from an early stage of the LBA-E program cycle.</li>
    </ul>
