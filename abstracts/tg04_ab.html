and Selectively-Logged Amazônian Forests</b></p>

Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC)<br>

<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We will study the rates and mechanisms of processes controlling carbon exchange and
trace gas fluxes at both old growth and selectively-logged forest sites in the Tapajós
National Forest and surrounding areas south of Santarém, Pará, Brazil. The work will
directly address two theme areas in LBA-ECO: Carbon Storage and Exchange, and Trace
Gas Fluxes. The proposed work can be divided into two primary objectives: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantification of air exchange rates and gas fluxes between old growth and selectively
        logged forests and overlying atmosphere utilizing continuous, in situ radon-222
        measurements</li>
      <li>Comparison of radon-derived exchange rate constants and fluxes with values derived from
        eddy correlation and flux chamber measurements by collaborating
        investigators.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Radon-222 measurements in forest canopy air, the atmosphere immediately overlying the
canopy, the soil atmosphere and in flux chamber samples will be performed in direct
collaboration with long-term tower flux and microclimate observations as well as automatic
flux chamber studies of trace gas exchanges by other LBA investigators. The most critical
assumption in the use of long-term eddy covariance to determine ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub>
balance is that the measurements are not biased from day to night (Goulden et al. 1996).
Because net carbon uptake reflects the difference between two larger fluxes, respiratory
efflux at night and photosynthetic uptake during the day, a small selective
underestimation of flux at night can cause a large overestimation of long-term
accumulation. Our radon work will be focused on and fully integrated with related studies
at two flux tower sites along the east side of the LBA transect proposed to be established
by a team of investigators. One of the towers will be located in undisturbed, old growth
forest (Wofsy and others) and the other in an area where selective logging will be carried
out during 1998 and 1999 (Goulden and others). The radon measurements, conducted in
collaboration with tower studies of heat, momentum, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and
other gas transport by Wofsy et al., Goulden, Fitzjarrald and Moore, and others, and flux
chamber studies by Keller, Crill, Trumbore and others, will provide direct quantification
of the physical exchange of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and other
trace gases between soils, the forest canopy, and the overlying atmosphere in undisturbed
versus logged areas. The radon measurements will employ multiple flow-through detectors
whose use in continuous tower flux studies has been pioneered by our group. The
multiple-detector set has been successfully deployed in tower studies at remote locations
in collaboration with other investigators for continuous measurements every 30 minutes for
periods of up to 4.5 years and at altitudes above the ground ranging from less than 10 cm
to 496 m.
</p>

<p>The following scientific questions will be addressed through collaborative efforts with
other LBA investigators: What are the rates of gas exchange between forest canopy air and
the atmosphere and how do these rates vary on daily and longer term temporal scales? How
does vertical gas mixing vary with elevation within the forest canopy? How do episodic
events (e.g. gust fronts) affect exchange between the sub-canopy layer and the free
troposphere? How does thinning of forest canopy caused by selective logging change the gas
exchange rate with the atmosphere and the relative importance of various canopy air
ventilation mechanisms? Does canopy structure affect the rate of episodic flushing of the
sub-canopy atmosphere? </p>

<p>Canopy/Atmosphere Gas Exchange Processes</p>

<p>Recent eddy correlation studies of carbon exchange over tropical forests suggest that
mature tropical evergreen forests may indeed be a significant carbon sink (Grace et al.
1995. The most critical assumption in the use of long-term eddy covariance to determine
ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> balance is that the measurements are not biased from day to night
(Goulden et al. 1996). Because net carbon uptake reflects the difference between two
larger fluxes, respiratory efflux at night and photosynthetic uptake during the day, a
small selective underestimation of flux at night can cause a large overestimation of
long-term accumulation. Grace et al. (1995) reported an annual uptake of 1 tC ha-1 that
reflected the difference between ~10 tC ha-1 uptake during daytime and ~9 tC ha-1 loss at
night. It is troubling that Grace et al's (1995) site was a carbon sink on days with calm
nights but not on days with windy nights. Perhaps there is a systematic underestimation of
C loss during stable periods particularly at night. This is a methodological concern for
all tower-based carbon measurements.

<p>Because most trace gases emitted by the biosphere are either photo-chemically or
biologically reactive, they are potentially unsuitable direct tracers for trace gas
transport within, out of or into vegetated land surfaces. However, radon-222, a
radioactive natural gas, is ideally suited for studies of gas exchange in the tropical
forests of Amazônia for the following reasons: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. it is emitted almost exclusively from the soil</p>
    <p>2. it is a chemically inert gas, making it suitable for tracing physical exchange
    between forests soils, canopies and the overlying atmosphere</p>
    <p>3. the only sink for radon is radioactive decay which can be easily quantified using
    its known decay constant</p>
    <p>4. its 3.8 day halflife yields nearly conservative behavior in studies of
    soil/atmosphere and canopy/atmosphere gas exchange </p>
    <p>5. existing technology now allows for continuous, multi-altitude radon activity
    measurements both within and above the forest canopy. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Trumbore et al. (1990; see equation 1) showed that radon-derived gas exchange rates
  compared favorably with estimates for CO<sub>2</sub> obtained by eddy correlation
  techniques (Fan et al., 1990; Fitzjarrald et al., 1990). Radon-222 was shown to have the
  potential to provide an independent and reliable measure of gas exchange rates between
  soils, forest canopy and the overlying atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p>Our group pioneered the deployment of continuous tower-based atmospheric radon-222
  activity measurements during the 1988 ABLE 3A mission near Bethel, Alaska (Martens et al.,
  1992; Martens, unpublished data) and began continuous, multi-altitude measurements every
  30 minutes at a micrometeorological tower site as part of ABLE 3B in the open-canopy,
  boreal forests of northern Québec, during the summer of 1990 (Ussler et al., 1994). The
  rate of gas exchange can be computed using a simple inventory model:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>where h is the canopy height, C is the spatial mean trace gas concentration within the
    canopy, S is the soil flux, k is a canopy gas exchange coefficient, Ct is the
    concentration of the trace gas in the overlying atmosphere, and P and L are production and
    loss, respectively of trace gas within the canopy. In practice the term on the left is
    evaluated by comparing concentration profiles at successive time points.
    Evapotranspiration is not an important source of radon within the Amazônian or boreal
    forest canopy, and radioactive decay loss of radon is insignificant as well, so the
    integral term on the right side of equation 1 is negligible and can be eliminated.</i> </p>
