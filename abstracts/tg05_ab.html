<p>Objectives</p>

<p>There are few, if any, ecosystem simulation models that have been well validated for
scaling up trace gas fluxes across land use patterns in the tropics. The research we
propose for LBA-ECO is to test a series of fundamental process-level hypotheses
related to specific land use effects on ecosystem biogeochemistry and trace gas fluxes in
the Amazon region. The main tool we will use for these tests is the daily model version of
CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) developed at NASA Ames Research Center (Potter et
al., 1997), specifically for Amazon land cover/use types. The modeling tests will be
conducted in close collaboration with experimental field studies planned for the LBA
intensive research sites. Our ultimate research goal is to validate our model applications
for different land uses at LBA sites and to scale-up regionally and dynamically the
plant-soil biochemical, hydrologic, and production components of the daily NASA-CASA
Amazon version, so as to more closely simulate and predict the inter-annual ecosystem
observations from LBA. We propose to take a lead role for LBA-ECO in organizing
comparative modeling studies at LBA intensive study sites, and in developing methods to
couple ecosystem models of production and biogeochemistry to simulation models and
assessments of land cover change for the Amazon region.<br>
</p>

<p>Research at NASA Ames has been supported for the past two years to refine and
extrapolate the monthly and daily moisture balance and regional plant production
components of our CASA model version for Brazil, through a joint research grant (National
Science Foundation-TECO #9524050) with collaborators (D. Nepstad et al.) at Brazil's
Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazon (IPAM) to study moisture relations in forests of
the eastern Amazon. Regional model drivers have been assembled and an Amazon-basin version
(8-km spatial resolution) of the NASA-CASA model has been completed under this grant
(Potter et al., submitted). Under LBA-ECO, we now propose to investigate the effects
of changing land use in more detail, through relatively high resolution (&lt;1 km2) model
applications that focus on ecosystem production, nutrient cycling, and biogenic trace
gases (BTG) exchange along important eco-climatic transects and at intensive LBA study
site locations. A central working hypothesis for our research is that the quality and
supply of decomposing plant material in soil is a major controller of mineralization rates
and trace gas flux during and after land use change. Interacting effects of soil moisture
holding capacity and canopy water relations must also be tested.<br>
</p>

<p>As a second new component of the study, we propose to develop and test methods of
scaling up our various cover-type versions of the model to produce regional flux estimates
(at 1-km to 8-km grid cell resolution) primarily of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O (and
secondarily of NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOC)) for
comparison (validation) with aircraft and tower eddy flux estimates and for input to
transport tracer models of the region. Our fundamental working hypothesis is that
large-scale conversion from primary forest to pasture and recovering forests represents a
substantial and sustained change in the basin-wide emission budgets for trace gases. To
address the LBA priority of scaling up flux estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O
(plus NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, and isoprene gases), we will conduct spatial model studies
chiefly for upland hydrologic environments. This will require continuous validation of the
model structure to represent major changes in soil moisture status, canopy cover, and
carbon/nutrient content of vegetation and soil with altered land cover/use, including
forest conversion to pasture, selective logging and secondary forest re-growth. We will
test land use effects on BTG flues from soils, nutrient mineralization from litter and
soil organic matter, nitrification rates, and plant nutrient recycling, with increasing
emphasis on phosphorus cycling in degraded areas and feedback to ecosystem production. As
we move closer to full regional scaling of simulations in the various land cover type, our
focus will be on testing model refinements related to broad scale drivers for rainfall,
cloud cover, vegetation types, inundation, and other soil attributes for simulations that
include the most current and detailed LBA results for land cover/use change in the Amazon.
<br>
</p>

<p>Our modeling research results will identify which factors (ecological and
anthropogenic) significantly influence key processes that control productivity and
biogeochemistry of tropical ecosystems, and have important sources of variability in the
spatial or temporal domains of interest in the LBA. Over the course of the project, we
will deliver to LBA's data information system (DIS) the research products from our Amazon
geographic information system (GIS) analysis, including evaluations of BTG fluxes,
evapotranspiration, soil C and N stocks, and mineralization fluxes at a grid resolution of
1-km to 8-km for the entire Brazilian Amazon basin. In addition, we present plans to
enhance our ongoing cooperative training component in ecosystem modeling for counterpart
scientists and students from Brazil. </p>
