<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We will carry out, at two sites and during the full multi-year period of LBA, weekly
measurements of the vertical profiles of several trace gas species and isotope ratios. We
will measure the mixing ratios of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>
and SF<sub>6</sub>, and the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O
isotopic ratios in CO<sub>2</sub>, in 20 flask samples collected automatically during each
flight up to an altitude of 3-5 km or more, depending on the altitude ceiling of available
local aircraft for hire. As they are available, we will use NASA, INPE or other research
aircraft to obtain samples at higher altitudes. Flask samples will be collected over the
ocean NE of Belem and over a forest area in the central Amazon basin in order to quantify
the change in trace gas mixing ratios and isotopic composition during the transit of air
across the basin. The central basin site will be coordinated with one of the flux tower
clusters. Other areas will be sampled on a campaign basis, and coordinated with other LBA
investigations, primarily to examine the isotopic signature of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in
other ecosystem types. The flasks will be analyzed in our laboratory in Boulder using
existing equipment, and all species mixing ratios and isotopic ratios will be firmly tied
to internationally accepted calibration scales. The observations will constitute the first
multi-year time series of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O mixing ratios
and CO<sub>2</sub> isotopic composition over the Amazon region. Measurements of SF<sub>6</sub>
will give a sensitive indicator for penetration of northern hemisphere air into the study
area. The data will provide an important constraint for regional and global models of
these trace gases, and an independent estimate of regional exchange for validation of
scaling of observations from the flux towers to the whole LBA study area. In addition, the
payload requirements for our equipment are modest, approximately 60 kg, and our aircraft
flights could be a useful resource for other investigators in LBA. </p>
