<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Soil Biogeochemistry of Carbon, Nutrients, and Trace Gases in the
Amazon Region of Brazil: Field Studies and Models of Natural and Managed Conditions</b></p>

</p>

<p>Objectives</p>

<p>We propose studies in three theme areas of LBA Ecology: carbon storage and exchange;
nutrient dynamics; and trace gas fluxes. We propose to work in undisturbed and logged
forest and in pastures in the area of the Tapajós National Forest south of Santarém,
Pará where we will contrast soil biogeochemical processes on sandy Ultisols and clay
Oxisols. </p>

<b>

<p>CARBON STORAGE AND EXCHANGE</b>. We will measure litter-fall and fine root biomass,
productivity, and decomposition on two common soil types in both logged and undisturbed
old- growth forest. We will provide a multi-year record of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange between
the soil and the atmosphere for old growth forest and logged forests on two soil types, as
well as for old and young pastures using different management approaches. For old-growth
forest, we will deploy automated soil enclosures to determine the largest component of
ecosystem respiration thereby providing a critical check on eddy covariance estimates of
carbon exchange. </p>

<b>

<p>NUTRIENT DYNAMICS</b>. We will compare nutrient stocks and cycling in litter and roots
on two contrasting soils. Analysis of nutrient retranslocation and experimental
fertilization of root-ingrowth cores will allow us to identify nutrient limitations. </p>

<b>

<p>TRACE GAS FLUXES</b>. We will obtain a continuous multi-year record of soil atmosphere
CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from old-growth forest,
logged forest, and pasture using automated and manual enclosures. These measurements will
be complemented by gas concentration profile measurements obtained continuously from
towers for N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> at 30-minute intervals in both undisturbed
and logged forest. Data screened for suitable atmospheric conditions will allow us to
estimate ecosystem fluxes for N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>. We will evaluate the
linkage between ecosystem productivity and N-oxide emissions in both pastures and forests
through measurements and simulations using DNDC. </p>

<p>Our coordinated measurements will link above- and belowground productivity and nutrient
cycles to trace gas exchange. Coordinated measurements and experimental manipulations will
allow us to gain a mechanistic understanding of the soil processes controlling carbon,
nutrient and trace gas dynamics. Measurements at a variety of temporal and spatial scales
will be synthesized using the framework of the DNDC biogeochemical model modified for
forest conditions. The understanding generated by this effort will be linked to ecosystem
productivity, a factor that may aid extrapolation beyond our research site. </p>

<p>Preferred Site</p>

<p>We hope to work on old-growth forest sites and logged forest sites in the Tapajós
National Forest south of Santarém, Pará and in pasture sites in the surrounding region. </p>

<p>Activities</p>

<p>We are assuming we can begin field activities in mid 1998 and that logging will occur
in July-December 1999. </p>
