<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The objectives of this project are to measure changes in key soil processes and
the fluxes of CO2, N2O, and NO associated with the conversion of tropical rainforest to
pasture in Rondônia. In sum, these measurements are intended to provide a comprehensive
quantitative picture of the nature of surface soil element stocks, C and nutrient
dynamics, and trace gas fluxes between soils and the atmosphere during the entire sequence
of land-use change from the initial cutting and burning of native forest, through planting
and establishment of pasture grass and ending with very old continuously-pastured land.
These results will also be used to develop process-based trace gas models.</p>

<p>This research is organized around three questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Question 1: How does the conversion of forest to pasture
    affect soil physical and chemical properties, C, N and P stocks, and C and N cycling
    rates?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Question 2: How does the conversion of forest to pasture
    affect the fluxes of CO2, N2O and NO between the soil and the
    atmosphere, and what are the major controls of these fluxes?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Question 3: What is the importance of land-use change to
    trace gas fluxes on the scale of Rondônia and of the entire Brazilian Amazon Basin?</li>
</ul>

<p>We have examined changes in the stocks of C, N and P and the cycling rates of C
and N in pastures three years old and older at Nova Vida. While this work documents
changes to biogeochemical processes over a wide range of pasture ages, it does not capture
the potentially large and important changes that occur in the early stages of forest
clearing and pasture establishment. To understand the dynamics of biogeochemical cycles
immediately after deforestation, our efforts related to this question will focus on the
study of changes in C, N and P stocks and C and N cycling rates in a newly created pasture
at Fazenda Nova Vida.</p>

<p>We will also measure the fluxes of N2O and NO in the forests and in the
established pastures along our existing sequences. Concurrent measurements of N2O, NO and
controlling factors will enable as to predict the ratios of the production of these
important gases under a variety of environmental conditions. We will also perform
plot-level manipulations in a forest and two pastures to examine controls on trace gas
fluxes. We will manipulate soil moisture and fertilize with N and P in a forest site and
pastures cleared in 1987 and 1972. These manipulations designed to study the degree to
which soil moisture and N and P availability control the fluxes of N2O and NO. The
understanding of controls of trace gas fluxes gained from these experiments will be used
by us to construct predictive models that will allow extrapolation to other soil types,
climate regimes and management regimes.</p>

<p>We will use ecosystem models of biogeochemical processes coupled with geographically
referenced information on land-cover and land-use change to estimate the changes in C and
N stocks and the fluxes of CO2, N2O and NO throughout the Brazilian Amazon for the past
two decades. Extant biogeochemistry models will be parameterized by us using results of
our own work in Brazil and the research of others working in Brazil and throughout the
new-world tropics. The biogeochemistry models will be of two types: response function
models such as MBL/TCM and processes-based models such as DNDC. We will then couple these
models with information organized in our geographic information system (GIS) on soils,
climate and ecosystem state (land cover and land use) to estimate gas fluxes.</p>

<p>Contribution to LBA-ECO</p>

<p>This study will contribute in several ways to ongoing interdisciplinary efforts
to understand the current biogeochemical functioning of Amazonia, the influence of the
dominant land-use change on that functioning and how these changes will ultimately
influence the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and
climate. First, information derived from field measurements of soil carbon balance and the
fluxes of greenhouse gases (N2O, CO2) following deforestation will provide an invaluable
empirical base from which to build Basin-wide assessments of changes to carbon stocks and
trace gas emissions through the use of GIS and other tools for regional extrapolation.
Second, new information on NO fluxes will contribute to understanding of the current
contribution of intact Amazonian forest to the regulation of atmospheric oxidant balance
and its potential for alteration following land cover conversion. Third, improved
understanding of nutrient and moisture controls on soil trace gas fluxes will permit
construction of process-based models that will improve the ability to predict future
consequences of land-use changes, land management practices and altered climate. Not only
will we contribute information to LBA but also measurements made by others in LBA will
serve as a check on our scaling attempts</p>
