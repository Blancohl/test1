<p>Objectives</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stable
isotopes measured in atmospheric N2O and its sources have been
proposed as constraints for the global N2O budget. As yet, few
measurements exist to characterize the most important natural source of N2O,
tropical soils. We have developed field sampling and laboratory methods to
measure stable isotopes in N2O emitted from soils. Preliminary
measurements in tropical rain forest soils show considerable spatial variation
in the d15N of N2O emitted during the rainy season, both
regionally with soil type, and locally, within a few meters. We hypothesize that
the causes of spatial variability in N2O emissions reflect
differences in microbial processes and physical transport. The work proposed
here will test specific hypothesis to explain the causes of spatial variability
in N2O emissions.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We
will investigate variability in N2O isotopes at the Tapajos National
Forest sites in collaboration with investigators in the NASA LBA-ECO
program. Measurements of the isotopic signature of N2O emitted from
the soil surface using chambers will quantify local variability. Depth profiles
of N2O concentration and isotopic signature at the same sites,
combined with diffusion modeling, will test the hypothesis that the depth of
maximum N2O production controls both the flux and isotopic signature
of N2O. The increase of N2O in the nocturnal canopy layer
will be used to determine the spatially integrated emission rate and isotopic
signature of the soil source averaged over hundreds of square meters for
comparison with other scaling methods. Regional variability in the isotopic
signature of N2O emissions along a soil textural gradient will be
related to soil physical properties and nutrient status. To test the role of NO3-
in inhibiting N2O reduction, we will apply NO3-
fertilizer and measure the resulting change in the isotopic composition of
emitted N2O. To facilitate modeling of the microbial pathways of N2O
production and consumption, we will determine 15N isotopic
fractionation factors associated with denitrification (NO3-
to N2O and N2O to N2) using both jar
incubations and in situ addition of 15N
labeled NO3- under conditions of different soil water
content. Isotopic measurements of N2O in each case will be
supplemented with measurements of the amount and isotopic composition of
extractable nitrate, ammonium, and soil organic matter, estimates of soil gas
diffusion rates based on soil water content and physical structure, and
measurements of N2O and NO fluxes. The complete data sets will allow
us to test models of soil N and C cycling that predict N2O emissions
at regional to global scales. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our
measurements will provide (1) better characterization of the isotopic signature
of this important N2O source for global budgets; (2) process-based understanding
linking the pathway of N2O production
(nitrification, denitrification) and the rate of loss (conversion to N2)
to the isotopic signature of emitted N2O; and (3) prediction of how
the isotopic signatures of tropical soil N2O emissions may change
following disturbance.<o:p>

<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The concentration of nitrous
oxide (N2O) has increased in the atmosphere since pre-industrial
times, and as a greenhouse gas, it contributes significantly to anthropogenic
radiative forcing. Its tropospheric mixing ratio is currently increasing
annually by about 0.25% per year. The reason for this increase seems to be
mostly dominated by agricultural intensification since 1500 AD, with a smaller
contribution from fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning and industrial
processes. Tropical forest soils are the largest natural source of N2O
to the atmosphere. Conversion of tropical forest for pasture and agricultural
use changes the rates of N2O emission from soils; however the net
effect of changing tropical land use on the N2O budget is poorly
known. The use of nitrogen fertilizers in tropical agricultural systems is
increasing rapidly, which will presumably increase tropical N2O
emissions in the future.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p>The use of stable isotopes
of N and O in atmospheric N2O and its sources has been proposed as a
way to better constrain the global N2O budget. In essence, the
overall tropospheric 15N &nbsp;and 18O
value for nitrous oxide represents the balance between&nbsp; N2O that is enriched in the heavy isotopes mixing down from the
stratosphere and oceanic and soil sources that are depleted in the heavy
isotopes.&nbsp; The lightest isotopic
signatures for N2O
measured are from nitrogen- fertilized agricultural fields. We are hypothesizing
that increased N2O
sources from agriculture have resulted in a measurable decline of 15N &nbsp;in
atmospheric N2O
over the past century (manuscript in preparation by Pérez et al.)<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The
majority of the available results for the isotopic signature of N2O
emitted from tropical soils in were measured in our laboratory, as part of the
PhD thesis of Tibisay Pérez. We have been able to explain the large spatial
variability in the isotopic signature of emissions as a combination of microbial
and physical processes influencing production and consumption of N2O
in soils (Pérez, Trumbore, Tyler, Davidson, and Keller, and Camargo, Isotopic
variability of N2O emissions from tropical forest soils, in press, Global
Biogeochemical Cycles). The work proposed for the new NSF grant will expand
on this previous work both looking at mechanisms of N2O
production and consumption in tropical forest, pasture and agricultural soils,
and attempting to do spatial averaging to estimate the global isotopic signature
of N2O emitted from tropical
soils.<o:p>

<p>Proposed Measurement Sites and Types of Measurements</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We
have proposed to work at two LBA field sites: <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify">A
    primary tropical forest in the FLONA Tapajós, Brazil in collaboration with
Keller, Crill and de Mello, as well as pasture/agricultural fields in
collaboration with E. Davidson/Sá in the Santarém and Paragominas area.<o:p>
</o:p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
A primary forest and a savanna site in Edelca station, La Gran Sabana, Bolivar
State, Venezuela, in collaboration with Dr. Eugenio Sanhueza of IVIC.<o:p>
</o:p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify">Measurements
will include: Isotopes in N2O
emissions from soils, N2O
concentrations and isotopes in soil and canopy air, amounts of N and 15N in KCl extractable ammonium, nitrate in soils and
in organic matter, incubation experiments to determine isotope fractionation
factors for 15N for
nitrification and denitrification. We intend to collaborate with other LBA
investigators to obtain access to vertical air profiles from towers. Some of the
analyses will be done at CENA, others will be done at IVIC (which will be
developing a stable isotope mass spectrometer facility). <o:p>

<p>Training and Education Plans</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Enir
Salazar da Costa, a Ph.D. student at UC Irvine (originally from Manaus, Brazil)
will do part of her Ph.D. thesis on measurements related to this proposal (she
will also work on radiocarbon isotopes as part of the CD-08 proposal led by
Trumbore and Camargo). We intend to include other local students in the work as
well (in both Venezuela and Brazil). Dr. Pérez is a Venezuelan citizen and will
be actively involved in educational efforts at IVIC.<o:p>
