<p class="default-style">Under the new Cooperative Agreement, we will perform the
following specific tasks in very active collaboration with our colleagues at USP.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">
    <p class="default-style">Evaluate
    the new SiB3 model for a series of Amazon flux sites. This will entail
    producing or obtaining from collaborators filled micrometeorological
    timeseries data (no missing values in any “driver” variable) from the
    three Tapajos sites, and from as many other sites as possible. We will then
    run multiyear simulations of latent and sensible heat and net ecosystem
    exchange of CO2 at each site with SiB3 using local site meteorlogy and
    vegetation parameters. We will compare the simulated and observed
    seasonality in the three fluxes among sites near Santarem, Manaus, Rondonia,
    and possibly others. We will investigate the influence of seasonal drought
    on gross photosynthesis and respiration, and evaluate model simulation of
    the seasonality of net carbon flux along regional gradients of vegetation
    and of timing, severity, and duration of the dry season.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="2" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">
    <p class="default-style">Analyze
    the two-way interaction between drought and physiological stress in
    Amazonian ecosystems and the implications for possible amplification and
    persistence of regional drought as simulated in the “Amazon catastrophe”
    experiment of Cox et al (2000). Coupled simulations with SiB2 in the CSU GCM
    can reproduce this phenomenon for current climate. We will investigate the
    cause of this phenomenon in the current model, and explore what must be done
    in fully coupled climate simulations to produce such a catastrophe, and what
    model changes are required to avoid it. This work will include local-scale
    simulations and comparison to drought stress observed in the field, as well
    as a range of fully coupled experiments with climate models.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="3" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">
    <p class="default-style">Perform
    a detailed analysis and forward simulation of the Santarém mesoscale
    campaign of July-August 2001 using SiB3/RAMS5. We will compare simulated to
    observed meteorology and tower fluxes at the three Tapajos towers. We will
    focus on the diurnal cycle of sensible and latent heat fluxes and CO2 flux
    at the three towers, diurnal development of&nbsp; the planetary boundary
    layer, its interaction with the regional trade wind circulation, and on
    mesoscale circulations in the presence of topography and rivers. We will
    also compare the time-varying vertical structure of CO2 in and just above
    PBL, and river-land contrasts of mid-morning CO2 on the two days during
    which we collected these data.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="4" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">
    <p class="default-style">Participate
    in a major campaign to be organized in the Tapajos region in 2003 or 2004 to
    investigate the Richey et al hypothesis of major fluxes of CO2 by evasion
    from inundated lands and open waters. We will provide modeling support using
    SiB3 and RAMS to simulate “background” fluxes from terre firme forests
    and pastures, and will also specify evasion fluxes from input obtained from
    collaborators. Our simulations will be used to interpret airborne and
    surface-based continuous measurements of CO2 and other tracers. This
    campaign will be coordinated with members of the Fitzjarrald, Saleska,
    Ehleringer, Bakwin, Melack, and Richey teams.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="5" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">
    <p class="default-style">Perform
    regional inversion analyses of data collected by the COBRA-Brazil field
    campaigns, using SiB3-RAMS and the Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model
    developed under the previous Cooperative Agreement. This will be carefully
    coordinated with other investigators, and is contingent on the approval of
    the field campaigns in 2003.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="6" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">
    <p class="default-style">Produce
    improved estimates of monthly Basin-wide carbon balance using a global
    atmospheric inversion method similar to the TransCom experiments. This will
    be improved by the inclusion of d13C of CO2 and CO as additional tracers to
    distinguish among biomass burning, C3 photosynthesis from forests and C4
    photosynthesis in pastures and cerrados. The new inversions will also make
    use of new data collected by airborne sampling (Bakwin/Artaxo team),
    continuous surface-based measurements of trace gases by the Saleska and
    Fitzjarrald teams, and isotopic measurements made by the Ehleringer/Ometto
    team.</li>
