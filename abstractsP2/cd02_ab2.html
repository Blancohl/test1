<p class="default-style">We propose two areas of research emphasis to better
understand and constrain estimates of carbon dynamics in Amazônia ecosystems,
based on progress during Phase I of LBA-ECO.&nbsp; These are (1) field
observations of stable isotope components of water and CO2 fluxes and (2)
development of mechanistic leaf and canopy models to link with other projects
evaluating ecosystem and regional carbon dynamics.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">(1) Stable isotope analyses of atmospheric CO2 are one
tool that scales processes from the soil and individual plant levels through to
the troposphere.&nbsp; We will apply 13C18O16O analyses as tools for better
understanding gas exchange processes within ecosystems and regionally across
ecosystems (forest, pasture, and river) in Manaus and Santarém.&nbsp; These
data will also directly contribute to regional and aircraft studies which rely
on ground observations for their data interpretation.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">(2) Mechanistic leaf, canopy and site-scale
canopy-scale models including isotope exchange are tools for extrapolating from
local scale measurements towards understanding carbon cycling on an ecosystem
and a basin-scale.&nbsp; Parameterized with leaf gas exchange characteristics
(functional response curves, N values, 13C18O16O and, canopy structure) and
driven by meteorological inputs, these models will be used to understand how
climate influences carbon gain at the canopy-ecosystem scale and will be <o:p>
</o:p>
used to link with eddy covariance studies (NEE estimates), atmospheric sampling
programs and regional carbon cycle modeling efforts as part of our science
integration.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">The proposed study will make several key LBA-Ecology
measurements at two primary regions: Manaus and Santarém:<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="default-style">• leaf-scale parameters to parameterize canopy
photosynthesis models</p>
<p class="default-style">• canopy scale photosynthesis models driven by
climate data</p>
<p class="default-style">• d13C and d18O values of stocks in forest and
pastures: leaves and soils</p>
<p class="default-style">• d13C and d18O values of CO2 effluxing from soils
and from the total ecosystem at forest and pasture sites</p>
<p class="default-style">• d13C and d18O values of ecosystem photosynthetic
discrimination in forests and pastures</p>
<p class="default-style">• d13C and d18O values of landscape-level respiration
(PBL)<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">Our studies will be conducted in close association with
eddy covariance measurements, atmospheric CO2 sampling, and regional carbon
modeling groups.&nbsp; The leaf and canopy-level models of carbon gain and of
isotope fractionation will linked directly with regional scale models. The
information gathered using our isotope studies will help in determining the role
of the Amazon Basin as a net sink or source of CO2 to the atmosphere.<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
