<p class="default-style" align="left">We propose observations and analyses to
infer transports of CO2, water vapor, and energy from the natural and the
disturbed regions of Amazonia.&nbsp; We ask support to continue ongoing direct
surface climate and flux measurements at several sites in LBA-ECO.&nbsp; Fluxes
will also be estimated using the boundary layer budget approach.&nbsp; A major
focus will be to determine how carbon fluxes are influenced by natural and
human-induced landscape inhomogeneities.&nbsp; Scales of inhomogeneities
addressed range from the river-land contrast, the pasture-forest contrast, and
the gap-closed canopy contrast inside the forest.&nbsp; Special attention will
go to understanding how changes in agricultural practices in the Amazon alter
carbon exchanges in cleared areas.&nbsp; One new initiative aims to improve
understanding of the respiration rate in forests by studying subcanopy flows.&nbsp;
A second new initiative to quantify canopy structure to relate this structure to
the forest flux tower observations is proposed.&nbsp; This proposal addresses
LBA-ECO Science Questions CD–Q1 CD–Q3b, and LC–Q1.
</p>
<p class="default-style">Our objectives are:</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">1) To observe
local wind circulations (river and land breezes, drainage flows) and assess
their influence on boundary layer development.&nbsp; To infer surface heat,
water vapor, and CO2 fluxes from&nbsp; temporal changes in their canopy and
boundary layer concentrations .</p>
<p class="default-style">2) To relate
light availability to the ecosystem to cloudiness, and to determine the
resulting effect on&nbsp; net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE).</p>
<p class="default-style">3) To quantify how land use change from pasture to
cultivation alters the carbon budget in one cleared area, and develop
parameterizations of exchange processes&nbsp; for modeling.

</p>
<p class="default-style">4) To quantify the vertical and horizontal structure of
the forest canopy near flux towers in the Tapajos National Forest.
</p>
<p class="default-style">5) To relate canopy structure n to turbulent
canopy-atmosphere exchange in regions of closed-canopy primary forest, near
natural gaps, and in the cut-over mosaic of a selectively logged site.
</p>
<p class="default-style">6)&nbsp; To reduce uncertainties in long-term tower flux
observations of the respiration rate )through better understanding the effect of
subcanopy drainage flows at two LBA-ECO Study Areas.</p>
