We propose to continue investigating the effects of selective logging on the
exchanges of CO2 and energy by a primary forest in the Tapajos National Forest (TNF),
Pará. Our study can be thought of as a large experimental manipulation, where
we use a range of techniques, including eddy covariance, to monitor forest
physiology before, during, and after selective logging.</p>
<p class="default-style" style="mso-line-height-alt:1.0pt;tab-stops:.5in">
We have been making eddy covariance measurements, and ground-based measurements
of soil respiration, litterfall, wood increment, and coarse woody debris, at the
Santarem km-83 site since 2000. As of March 2002 we had collected, and submitted
to Beija-Flor, 20 months of nearly continuous tower-flux observations.&nbsp; The
first 14 months of observations were made while the forest was relatively
undisturbed.&nbsp; These data served as the basis for three submitted
manuscripts that detail the exchanges of CO2 and energy by the intact forest.
The remaining 6 months of observations were made after the forest was
selectively logged in September 2001. The logging operation, which was conducted
by a local firm using reduced impact procedures, covered ~400-ha of forest that
extended ~2-km upwind of the tower. The loggers removed only ~6% of the biomass
in large trees, but left another ~18% of the biomass in large trees as slash,
and eliminated ~13% of the canopy on an area basis.&nbsp; Preliminary analysis
of the tower observations indicate that canopy photosynthesis declined by ~15%
following logging, and that ecosystem respiration increased in the subsequent
wet season.&nbsp;</p>

In this proposal we request support to complete our study by continuing these
observations for three more years.&nbsp; Our goal is to use the combined tower
and ground-based observations to quantify the forest’s response to, and
recovery from, logging. We will do this in collaboration with other researchers
working in Santarem, and, in particular those making flux measurements at the
km-67 tower (CD10, Wofsy PI; TG07, Keller and Crill PIs), which serves as an
undisturbed control for the km-83 tower, and those making additional
measurements at the km-83 tower (TG07, Keller and Crill PIs; CD03 Fitzjarrald
PI, and TG04,&nbsp; Martens PI).&nbsp; Additionally, we will focus efforts on
scientific integration within LBA, both among researchers working in Santarem,
and among all tower groups within LBA.&nbsp; Finally, we will continue our
educational activities by further involving Brazilian students in the research,
both at UCI and USP, as well as in Santarem.</p>
