<p class="default-style">Amazonia has entered an era of rapid change as new transportation corridors
traverse the region, stimulating the expansion of logging and agricultural
frontiers.&nbsp; This large experiment in infra-structure investments presents
an important scientific challenge to the LBA community—to simulate the effects
of transportation infra-structure on regional patterns of land-use change and
carbon emission.&nbsp; In this second phase of our LBA grant we propose to
develop and refine a process-based model of ecosystem productivity and fire
probability and economic models of agriculture and forestry that begin to
address this challenge.&nbsp; These models will be coupled within a
Pan-Amazonian GIS, and will be responsive to plausible policy scenarios, as
model inputs.&nbsp; Model outputs will include spatially-explicit simulations of
future land uses, fire regime, and associated carbon emissions.&nbsp; The
interaction between land cover and regional climate will be investigated using
both a meso-scale climate model (RAMS) and a global circulation model (COLA/CPTEC).&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="default-style">We will help reduce the considerable uncertainty about areas of logging and
understory fire in Amazonia by geo-referencing, through fieldwork, the
perimeters of logging and forest fire scars in each of five “reference
landscapes”.&nbsp; Vegetation structure and biomass will be measured within a
subsample of patches in each landscape.&nbsp; We will also establish a
prescribed burn experiment in the Amazon-Cerrado transition forest of Mato
Grosso.&nbsp; The proposed research will also be supported by datasets being
collected at our ongoing rainfall exclusion experiments in Amazonia and the
Cerrado (LC-14), and by measurements of sub-soil controls on the ecological
dynamics of forest-savanna ecotones.</p>
