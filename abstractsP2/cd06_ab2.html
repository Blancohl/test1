<p class="default-style">Our research addresses the overall role rivers and
periodically inundated environments play in the biogeochemical cycles of the
Amazon Basin. Recent evidence suggests that outgassing of CO2 is of comparable
magnitude to the lower estimates of carbon sequestration by forests. We have two
primary objectives:
</p>
<p class="default-style">Objective 1. Complete research on the question of landuse
change and its consequences for water chemistry in the Ji-Paraná River Basin

</p>
<p class="default-style">Objective 2. Expand research on the fluxes of gases between wetlands
and the atmosphere, by testing the working hypothesis that “CO2 evasion
returns as much carbon to the atmosphere as is sequestered in upland forests on
an interannual basis.&nbsp; Export of organic material from upland and riparian
forests to fluvial environments is the primary source of carbon that is
eventually respired in rivers and evaded as CO2.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">We
are addressing our objectives by (1) Conducting fieldwork in characteristic
sub-basins to complete water chemistry and to obtain an extensive suite of pCO2
distribution measurements over the hydrologic regime, and to use proven
geochemical techniques (gas flux measurements, isotopic tracers,
remineralization rates) to quantify the rates of the lateral transfer and
cycling of water and bioactive organic matter from the land, through riparian
environments and to the river system. (2) Using a terrestrial source/river
transport and reaction model to synthesize and extrapolate the site-specific CO2
evasion rate measurements to a basin-wide estimate of CO2 evasion rate. The work
will be executed across a series of environments (primarily Manaus, Ji-Parana,
Bananal, Acre, Caxiuana, Mato Grosso, and hopefully Tefe). This will be done by
setting up specific student-based collaborations at each site, coordinated
through CENA. The overall research here is relevant to a series of the LBA-ECO
Science questions.&nbsp; The work considers explicitly the effects of changing
land use, the relation of surface water chemistry to regional flow patterns, and
the role of the extensive wetlands and temporarily inundated or saturated areas
in Amazônia.
