<p class="default-style">Our overall goals are to
quantify the contributions of different components of the carbon cycle to
overall ecosystem carbon balance in Amazonian tropical forests and to undertake
process studies at a number of sites along the eastern LBA transect to
understand how and why these fluxes vary with site, season, and year. We are
dividing this work into a number of specific tasks: (1) determining the average
rate (and variability) of tree growth over the past 3 decades; (2) determining
age demographics of tree populations, using radiocarbon to determine tree age;
(3) assessing the rate of production and decomposition of dead wood debris; (4)
determining turnover rates for organic matter in soils and the mean age of C
respired from soil using radiocarbon measurements; and (5) comparing our results
with models and constructing models to predict the potential of tropical forests
to function as sources or sinks of C.</p>
<p class="default-style">The overall
picture of tropical forest C dynamics emerging from our Phase I studies suggests
that the fraction of gross primary production allocated to growth in these
forests is only 25-30%, as opposed to the 50% assumed by many ecosystem models.&nbsp;
Consequent slow tree growth rates mean greater mean tree age for a given
diameter, as reflected in our measurements and models of tree age.&nbsp;
Radiocarbon measurements in leaf and root litter suggest that carbon stays in
living tree biomass for several years up to a decade before being added to
soils, where decomposition is rapid. The time lags predicted from 14C, when
coupled with climate variation on similar time scales, can lead to significant
interannual variation in net ecosystem C exchange.</p>
<p class="default-style">In Phase II
we will continue our measurements to observe how forest C budgets can vary from
year to year with climate.&nbsp; In addition to filling gaps in our stand-level
C budgets, activities we will (1) expand our efforts in integration across sites
through modeling, and (2) augment our existing measurements where needed to
facilitate modeling (through availability of continuous temperature and moisture
data), or to fill gaps in coverage of C cycle components, and (3) continue
measurements begun in the past year to study differences in C dynamics between
primary forest and other land cover types (flooded forest and cerrado). Some
more detailed physiological measurements begun by Chambers, Higuchi, Santos, and
Tribuzy at the INPA ZF2 forest and FLONA seca floresta project will continue in
Year 1.</p>
