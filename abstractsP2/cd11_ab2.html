<p class="default-style">For 2003 we are going to identify and measure biomass, canopy damage,
fuel loads and regrowth and in different types of burned and logged forest in
northern Mato Grosso (Guaranta), similar to what was done for Santarem/ Belterra
site and started for Paragominas site in 2001 and 2002. The goal is to identify
differences in forest structure and its response to disturbances by to fire and
logging among different types of forest (dense forest intensive logged, dense
forest moderate logging, and transitional forest intensive logging). More
specifically, the field work will be done in private property areas and account
for direct measurements of forest structure, informal field interviews to check
and reconstruct the forest disturbance history and ground truth for remote
sensing analysis. Logging and fire maps are already done for this area using
remote sensing image classification and visual interpretation. The field
measurements will be used to parameterize the remote sensing image and improve
the classification done previously. </p>
<p class="default-style">For 2004 and 2005, we&nbsp;will expand the study&nbsp;to open forests&nbsp;with
intensive and moderate logging and to&nbsp;transitional forests&nbsp;with
moderate logging. The existing grant ends in 2003, however, and the fieldwork&nbsp;for
2004 and 2005 will depend on obtaining renewed funding.</p>
