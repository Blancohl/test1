    <p>Using longitudinal household survey data collected in 1990 and 1999, a 2000 community survey, a multi-resolution remote
    sensing time series, GIS coverage of resource potentials and endowments, and field verification and geodetic control data, we analyze
    the determinants of changes in LCLU at the plot, sector, and regional levels, and annual and decadal periods.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> The fundamental research questions revolve around (a) the rates, and mechanisms of forest conversion to agricultural and urban uses, (b) the relative importance of
    exogenous and endogenous variables on these land uses, (c) the associated scale dependant drivers of LCLU dynamics and patterns
    operating across socio-economic and demographic, biophysical, and geographical domains; (d) rate and pattern of land conversion
    from forest to agricultural crops, pasture, secondary plant succession, and urbanization, as well as the rate and pattern of land
    abandonment at the farm level; and (e) plausible scenarios of future land cover change and their policy implications as assessed
    multi-level models that are responsive to multi-scale effects as well as spatial simulations of LCLU dynamics through a cellular automata
    approach.</p>

    The survey periods and the assembled satellite time-series images serve as our reference dates that are integrated to define
    relationships through (1) multivariate logit models of LCLU for 1990, 1999, and for changes between those two survey periods; (2)
    satellite image classifications and change-detections of LULC dynamics, space-time trajectories of pixel histories, and pattern metrics of
    landscape organization to define LCLU composition and spatial structure; (3) LCLU simulation through cellular automata, informed by
    the satellite and multivariate models of LCLU change, to create spatial simulations of LULC dynamics; and (4) multi-level models to
    integrate variables and effects from multiple scales into an integrated model of LCLU dynamics to assess the scale
    dependence of variable interactions on LCLU patterns.&nbsp;
    <p> The analysis will be framed within a dynamic systems approach that emphasizes non-linear
    relationships, feedback, mechanisms, and critical thresholds in population-environment interactions.
    Theoretical foundations include principles involving the interplay of political ecology, human ecology, landscape ecology, and complexity theory.</p>
