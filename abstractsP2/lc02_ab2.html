<p class="default-style" style="text-align:justify">Southwestern Amazonia of
Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru, an area of about 1.5 million km2, has shifted from
being the hinterland to the forefront of development in the Amazon Basin.&nbsp;
Major highways will soon traverse this region, linking it to Pacific Rim
economies. Madre de Dios Department, Peru, eastern Acre State, Brazil, and Pando
Department, Bolivia—the MAP region of about 200,000 km2—constitute the heart
of southwestern Amazonia and the research site for this proposal. Recent public
policy decisions have the potential of dramatically changing land use and land
cover in the region.&nbsp; Existing data, however, are inadequate to decipher
such change. We propose to conduct calibration and accuracy assessments of
several factors associated with such changes: 1) Validation of fire pixel data
from GOES/AVHRR/MODIS imagery. This comparison will serve not only for Acre, but
will also provide a calibrated GOES half-hourly fire data set for the period of
1998 to 2005 for all of Amazonia; 2) Deforestation estimates of PRODES/INPE, of
other state and federal agencies, and of LBA research for the MAP region. Such
comparisons at validation sites will permit accuracy assessments of current and
past deforestation data for Amazonia; 3) Estimates of the rapidly growing
logging activity in the MAP region. This will include extensive fieldwork and
permit comparison with remote-sensing-based estimates of forest canopy opened by
logging; 4) Demographic and economic data in the tri-frontier municipalities. We
will conduct sensitivity analysis of these data coupled with high-resolution
imagery of growing urban centers along the frontier for validation; 5)
Preliminary analysis of energy resources in southwestern Amazonia; and 6)
Participatory Scenario Planning that will provide new information as to the
aspirations of local and regional societies.&nbsp; <o:p>

<p class="default-style" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">The above
information will also provide data for a case study of Pan-Amazon modeling of
plausible scenarios for land use in the region.&nbsp; We have collaborators from
all three countries and a history of developing the regional scientific
community on land use and land cover change. We will continue to expand
collaboration with state and municipal governments in Acre State and to develop
complementary activities with Bolivian and Peruvian universities and
institutions on land use and global change.&nbsp; Our program will strengthen
the only graduate program on natural resource management in lowland southwestern
Amazonia and advance our goal to help educate Amazonian researchers in land use.&nbsp;
We intend to integrate LBA results into regional education systems so that the
results of LBA will help Amazonian societies decide how they wish to develop the
region.<span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>
