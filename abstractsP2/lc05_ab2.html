<p class="default-style">Objectives</p>

<p class="default-style">This investigation seeks to understand the impacts of
prevalent land-use changes such as habitat fragmentation and forest regeneration
on the dynamics of biomass and carbon storage in Brazilian Amazonia.&nbsp;
Further goals include assessing the effects of anthropogenic climate change and
El Niño-related droughts on fragmented and intact forests.&nbsp; This project
is also playing a vital role in providing advanced training for Amazonian
graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and government
decision-makers.</p>
<p class="default-style">A key strategy of this investigation is to extrapolate
upward from intensive studies at local and landscape scales to much larger
regional and basin-wide scales.&nbsp; This is accomplished by various modeling
approaches that link long-term studies of forest dynamics and biomass in
fragmented and regenerating forests in central Amazonia with remote-sensing
data, including Landsat TM and AVHRR at regional scales, and higher-resolution
techniques at landscape and local scales.</p>
<p class="default-style">This study incorporates one of the world’s most
important datasets on tropical forest dynamics.&nbsp; Within the 1000-km2 study
area of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) near Manaus,
a long-term (&gt;23 year) investigation of forest biomass, carbon-cycle
dynamics, and plant diversity and community composition is being conducted using
69 1-ha plots in fragmented and intact forests.&nbsp; Within these plots,
&gt;60,000 large (&gt;10 cm diameter) trees of ca. 1,200 species have been
continuously monitored since 1980.&nbsp; In addition, virtually all other
components of aboveground biomass (small trees, saplings, seedlings, palms,
lianas, snags, fine and coarse wood debris, litter standing stock) are being
quantified, providing insights of unparalleled detail into the striking
ecological impacts of forest fragmentation on carbon storage and cycling and
plant-community dynamics.</p>
<p class="default-style">In addition, long-term biomass studies are being
undertaken to help determine whether intact Amazonian forests are functioning as
a significant carbon sink (possibly in response to increasing CO2
fertilization).&nbsp; Carefully selected plot chronosequences are being used to
study the dynamics of carbon sequestration and floristic change in forests
regenerating on abandoned lands, and are revealing the critical role of
disturbance history in forest regeneration.&nbsp; <o:p>
