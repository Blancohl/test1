 Building on 30 years of research experience in the Amazon, this study will
advance our understanding of land use and land cover change through integrative
science activities and&nbsp; by collaboration with 11 other LBA projects. This
project builds on a seven-region study, along the LBA transects, supported for
six years by NSF and NIGEC, and then for the past three years by LBA funds.&nbsp;
We have used a nested-georeferenced approach that collected soil analyses,
vegetation stand structure and composition (100+ sites), land use histories,
institutional analyses, demography of&nbsp; 600+ households, and land cover
classification using Landsat&nbsp; MSS and TM multitemporal data to understand
land use and land cover change (LCLUC) trajectories. The seven regions in our&nbsp;
study,&nbsp; represent a soil fertility gradient across Amazonia from most (i.e.
alfisols) to least (i.e. spodosols) fertile and include&nbsp; a wide array of
land uses and land cover types along an east-to-west transect extending from the
Amazon estuary and Bragantina region east of Belém, all the way to Rondônia in
the west.<o:p>

<p class="default-style">We
propose in phase II of this NASA/LBA project to extend this work by:<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" >1.&nbsp;
Developing a multi-scale synthesis of land use and land cover change dynamics
integrating our seven study areas, in order to understand the role of
demographic, economic, institutional and biophysical variables on LCLUC
trajectories during the past 25 years.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" >2.&nbsp;
Developing a multi-sensor analysis of the capabilities and limitations of
different platforms (IKONOS-TM &amp; ETM+-MODIS)&nbsp; for land cover
discrimination using the full capabilities of artificial neural networks&nbsp;
for classification and modeling.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" >3.
Developing an integrated study of land use, land cover, and land-water
interactions by using a watershed approach encompassing at least two of our most
intensive research sites (i.e. the Santarém-Altamira region), thereby
addressing fundamental questions of the landscape-level controls on
nutrient-carbon interactions within, and sustainability of forests in the Amazon
Basin.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">4.
Developing a comprehensive scientific collaboration strategy within LBA projects
to contribute to modeling and synthesis efforts by formal collaboration with 11
LBA projects, hands-on training, and dissemination of a data management CD for
the benefit of all of LBA.</p>
