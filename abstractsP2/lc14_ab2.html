<p class="default-style" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in">Drought is
changing moist tropical forests in Amazonia and elsewhere. Drought severity has
increased in these regions in association with El Niño events and may increase
further through global warming and land use change. The consequences of this
trend include potentially large effects on greenhouse gas emissions, tree
mortality, reproductive biology, biogeochemistry, and forest flammability.
During the 1998 El Niño episode, for example, approximately one third of Amazon
forests experienced depleted soil moisture and may have become susceptible to
fire. An integrated understanding of the responses of moist tropical forests to
severe drought has eluded the scientific community in part because intensive
field studies of episodic natural drought “experiments” are extremely
difficult.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in">In this
research, we continue a large-scale throughfall reduction experiment in an
Amazon forest. Predicted responses to a total of 5 years of
experimentally-induced drought and 2 years of release from drought stress will
be tested.&nbsp; The study exploits the research infrastructure previously
established with NSF funding, including one-hectare control and treatment study
plots with canopy towers (8), catwalks (200 m), 12-m soil shafts (10) and
perimeter trenches (800 m). The plots were compared during a one-year
calibration period prior to treatment initiation.&nbsp; Measurements include
stem and root sapflow, photosynthesis, leaf water potential, xylem cavitation,
fine root dynamics, soil water, canopy phenology, stem growth, stem respiration,
nutrient fluxes through the forest canopy, floor and soil, and soil fluxes of
CO2, CH4, N2O and NO. Beginning in 2000, throughfall has been partially excluded
from the treatment plot with 5,660 plastic panels that are installed in the
understory during the rainy season and removed during the dry season. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in">Forests
growing on deep, clay soils throughout much of Amazonia are buffered against the
effects of moderate droughts by the large amount of water stored in the rooting
profile.&nbsp; But even mild drought elicits important forest responses.&nbsp;
After excluding 890 mm of throughfall in 2000 and 680 mm in 2001 from the
one-hectare treatment plot, several unanticipated forest responses were
documented that would have been very difficult to detect without a throughfall
manipulation of this magnitude.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" style="text-indent:.5in">A reduction in soil methane
emissions relative to the control plot appeared within days of installation of
the exclusion panels. Surprisingly, a reduction in the growth of small tree
stems (&lt;20 cm diameter) and a reduction in sap flow were the next major
treatment responses, appearing during the dry season of the first treatment
year.&nbsp; This decline in stemwood production of nearly 1 Mg ha-1 yr-1 is
sufficient to offset the net carbon sink that has been reported for Amazon
forests.&nbsp; The anticipated reduction of leaf area index (LAI) appeared only
during a second phase of drought in which deep soil moisture depletion began,
accompanied by declines in leaf water potential. Most of the LAI reduction was
caused by decreases in new leaf production instead of through increased leaf
shedding. Hence the stomatal closure provoked by mild drought stress was
manifested as slower stemwood growth; leaf production declined only as deep soil
moisture supplies were depleted. Estimates of NPP allocation to belowground
production are awaiting further analyses, but soil respiration measurements
indicate little total change.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style" style="text-indent:.5in">During the next three years of
throughfall reduction, a third phase of drought responses is predicted in which
further soil moisture depletion provokes xylem embolism and the death of trees
and tree branches. Tree- and branchfall gaps will open the forest understory to
sunlight, but soil moisture deficits will limit the recovery processes that gap
formation usually triggers. Soil trace gas emissions will respond both to
changes in soil aeration and to changes in substrate availability caused by root
mortality. Movement of solutions through the soil profile will depend upon root
distributions, water content, and hydraulic conductivity.&nbsp; Forest floor
accumulation combined with drought-induced reduction in leaf area index will
greatly increase forest flammability. After cessation of the throughfall
reduction treatment, persistent xylem damage in surviving large trees may
restrict the supply of water to canopy foliage and suppress photosynthesis for
years, while gaps are quickly filled by saplings and vegetative sprouts. <o:p>

<p class="default-style">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These complex forest responses to drought, and the cessation of drought, will be
tested and modeled. Field measurements will be used to test and refine canopy
metabolism and forest models, improving our ability to simulate the responses of
moist tropical forests to severe drought, and the cessation of drought. This
experiment is the focus of 6 PhD dissertations, 2 MS theses, 5 undergraduate
theses, and numerous field ecology courses, and has been widely disseminated in
the popular media.<o:p>
