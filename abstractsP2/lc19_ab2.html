The Cerrado and Amazon Forest – Cerrado transition are the most intensely
stressed areas in Brazil, with rapid and aggressive land use conversions.&nbsp;
This study aims to scale-up and extrapolate ground-measured ecological
parameters, such as fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (fAPAR)
and leaf area index (LAI), over this fragmented and heterogeneous region in
Brazil.&nbsp; Synoptic and repetitive fAPAR and LAI estimations are crucial as
inputs in regional-scale productivity and carbon budget models, prompting many
remote sensing investigations for the development of techniques for
satellite-based LAI/fAPAR retrievals.<o:p>

We propose low level AVIRIS flights for scaling-up field measured, ecologic
parameters (fAPAR, LAI, %cover) across an environmental gradient spanning the
diverse Brazilian cerrado biome (dry grassland – woodland cerrado – cerrado-forest
transition) to the seasonal Amazon forest biome, including their land use and
land converted classes.&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of the scaling-up process, we will
use AVIRIS hyperspectral reflectances to identify and discriminate the natural
and altered land cover classes along the gradient of vegetation types using
mixture models based on 'pure spectral signatures' of 'endmember' grassland,
woodland, forest classes. This refined land cover characterization will be used
in the scaling up of fAPAR, LAI, and % cover to AVIRIS pixel size (5 m) and the
coarser Landsat ETM+ (30 m) and MODIS (250 m to 1 km) sensors. Our scaling and
extrapolation approach will result in regional mapped products, with an accuracy
and uncertainty fields, that account for distinct, land cover dependent,
functional relationships between ecologic parameter (linear and non-linear) and
vegetation indices. The scaled-up regional products will account for
inter-sensor translation and continuity and will provide an independent
'validation' of the LAI/fPAR, land cover, and surface reflectance/VI MODIS
products (both Terra and Aqua) for the cerrado, &nbsp;transition, and forest
study areas.&nbsp; The results of this study will enable the detection of
'hotspots' of land conversion activities with the MODIS sensor;&nbsp; enable for
their fine-scale analysis with the Landsat ETM+ sensor or ASTER sensor; and
allow a time-series analysis with the AVHRR historical data. This will greatly
aid seasonal and inter-annual carbon balance studies in the Cerrado and Amazon
transition regions.<o:p>
