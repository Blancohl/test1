  <p class="default-style">Selective logging is a
  dominant form of land use in the Brazilian Amazon.&nbsp; Several LBA studies
  are quantifying the effects of logging on carbon dynamics, including the role
  of fire as an agent of continued change following timber harvest.&nbsp;
  Despite ongoing efforts, surprisingly little is known about the extent,
  intensity or biogeochemical effects of logging in Amazon forests.&nbsp; At the
  scale of the entire Basin, the extent of logging is hotly contested, with
  current estimates ranging from 2,000-15,000 km2 yr-1.&nbsp; Even less is known
  about the intensity of logging, where intensity is defined here as canopy
  structural damage caused by the harvest operation.&nbsp; Moreover, there
  exists almost no information on changes in nutrient stocks and dynamics in
  selectively logged forests.&nbsp; The fate of nutrients could be central to
  determining rates of regrowth and the long-term sustainability of timber
  harvesting in Amazonia.</p>
  <p class="default-style">During the past two years,
  we have tested a method to quantify both the extent and intensity of selective
  logging using Landsat ETM+ data with a Monte Carlo spectral mixture model.&nbsp;
  The method produces coverages of fractional canopy, bare soil and surface
  necromass (slash) cover, along with statistical uncertainty maps for each
  cover fraction.&nbsp; The canopy fractional cover results have proven highly
  correlated with field-measured forest gap fraction, which in turn, is
  spatially correlated with the volume (and biomass) of wood removed from the
  forest and the coarse woody debris remaining in the harvest sites.&nbsp; This
  approach opens the door to regional-scale studies of logging extent and
  intensity as well as the resulting changes in carbon and nutrient stocks.&nbsp;
  Before considering the method viable for basin-wide logging studies,
  additional testing is needed across a wider range of forest structural types,
  logging regimes and in areas subjected to fire following harvest.&nbsp;
  Additional studies are also needed to determine the functional, quantitative
  linkages between satellite-observed changes in forest canopy cover and exposed
  surface slash, carbon stock changes in vegetation and soils, and nutrient
  cycling.</p>
  <p class="default-style">We propose to extend our
  remote sensing approach to a much larger region of the Amazon, and to further
  develop linkages between our satellite analyses and measured carbon and
  nutrient changes.&nbsp; The satellite studies will take place primarily in
  Para and Mato Grosso states, and will cover the period 1999-2004.&nbsp; We
  will use the fractional cover maps to direct field studies and continued
  canopy gap fraction validation efforts across a range of forest types.&nbsp;
  The field sites will include low- and high-damage logging blocks with and
  without fire, and additional areas containing forest structural variation
  under study by groups led by Dan Nepstad, Foster Brown, Emilio Moran, and
  other LBA collaborators.&nbsp; At a subset of sites within the imagery, we
  will quantify changes in vegetation and soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and base
  cation stocks.&nbsp; Using established logging chronosequences, we will
  measure changes in nutrient pools, mineralization rates and other key nutrient
  cycling processes to determine the short-term and the potential long-term
  effects of harvest on nutrient availability.&nbsp; We will use the canopy
  damage information derived from Landsat ETM+ to spatially integrate nutrient
  and carbon data, and to predict regional-scale changes in nutrient stocks and
  their partitioning in vegetation and soils.&nbsp; Our results will be compared
  to studies of intact forest underway by other LBA teams.&nbsp; We will also
  use the Landsat analyses of logging extent and intensity to assess linkages
  between logging practices and the spatial and temporal patterns of fire
  occurrence over large regions of the eastern Amazon.&nbsp; Fire occurrence
  data have been and will be provided by the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM)
  satellite, and will be validated during our (and Nepstad’s) proposed field
  studies.</p>
  <p class="default-style">The project will produce a
  set of tangible products to be freely shared by LBA investigators and
  Brazilian agencies such as EMBRAPA and INPE.&nbsp; These include: (1) regional
  maps of selective logging extent and canopy damage for 1999-2004; (2) nutrient
  stock and flux data partitioned by forest and soil types, and by landscape
  units such as logging decks, roads, skid trails, and tree-falls; (3) spatially
  integrated nutrient budgets showing how nutrients are altered by logging; and
  (4) regional maps of canopy damage from logging in relation to fire occurrence
  from field and TRMM satellite data.&nbsp; This project will have a strong
  educational component, including: (a) training a Brazilian and an American
  post-doc, including exchange between the co-PIs labs; (b) training students
  from the Universidade de Brasilia in remote sensing studies and field methods;
  (c) training of EMBRAPA personnel in the use and validation of the satellite
  results; and (d) outreach to Brazilian land managers interested in the use of
  satellite data for logging operations (technology transfer).</p>
  <p class="default-style">The project will directly
  address LBA questions LC-Q3, CD-Q3b, CD-Q3c, and ND-Q1.&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing
  so, we will contribute to answering the overall LBA question: “How do
  tropical forest conversion, re-growth and selective logging influence carbon
  storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable
  land use in Amazonia?”</p>
