  <p class="default-style">Why is it important to monitor fires in the Amazon?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The role of fires in tropical ecosystems has been established (Goldammer,
  1990).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout the 80s and
  early 90s, constantly increasing human forcing and climate anomalies made
  forest fires in the Amazon Basin a major environmental issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Federal efforts have been directed at early detection and management of
  uncontrolled wildfires (Pereira et al., 1999) and fires play a role in the
  regional carbon cycle (Potter et al., 2001).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, not all fires are equal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Some fires result in a major <i>conversion</i> of the landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>While in other locations, fires are necessary to <i>maintain</i> the
  landscape (Eva and Lambin, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
  land management and carbon science efforts continue to expand, it will be
  important to “filter” fire maps to differentiate between conversion and
  maintenance fires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To develop
  such a filter, research is needed on the relationship between land cover and
  fire data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to the large
  extent of the LBA region and the current use of remote sensing for regional
  fire monitoring (Pereira et al., 1999), this research needs to be based on
  land cover and fire products derived from satellite data available throughout
  the region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="default-style">Existing work on fire and land cover maps indicates
  there is a relationship between fire occurrence and land cover dynamics, but
  the <i>form</i> of that relationship depends on the initial and subsequent
  land cover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, there were
  areas for improvement in the data quality cited in that work (Eva and Lambin,
  2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To address these
  shortfalls we propose to investigate the relationship between land cover and
  fire maps within the context of validation of new MODIS fire products.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This will allow us to leverage off existing equipment and
  infrastructure within the region and take advantage of the new capabilities
  offered by MODIS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With this, we
  focus on two separate, complementary, components:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="default-style" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;

  </span><b>Quantifying the uncertainly in satellite derived fire and burn scar
  products, concentrating primarily on new MODIS fire products and</b></p>

  change and fires that maintain a state of equilibrium<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </b><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="default-style">The first component will provide validated products
  to quantify the extent and timing of burning in the Amazon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>NASA has an interest in having its latest tools and data products
  utilized to the furthest extent possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>By teaming with the IBAMA, the Brazilian agency responsible for
  national fire monitoring, the proposed effort will help integrate new MODIS
  fire products into the region and help establish the use of these products
  into the operational fire monitoring and managemnent of IBAMA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The geolocation accuracy (~50m) and multiple overpasses (4 per day with
  Aqua and Terra) imply fire products from MODIS offer enhanced locational
  accuracy and the ability to capture diurnal characteristics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, before these products are put into operational use, they will
  need to be validated in a rigorous way; where uncertainties in the product are
  quantified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first component
  of our effort will meet this need.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="default-style">The second component will address the management and
  carbon cycle question on the interaction between fire and land cover dynamics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Using the validated products from the first component, we will build on
  the integrative nature of the LBA program by coupling IBAMA’s fire products
  with existing and forthcoming land cover maps developed by the LBA program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>By coupling the best available regional fire products with the latest
  land cover maps the second component will determine fire’s influence in
  answering the questions posed in the LBA solicitation.</p>

  <p class="default-style">Overall scientific and technical expertise will be
  realized by the collaboration between IBAMA and the MODIS fire product team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>IBAMA is responsible for operational fire monitoring in Brazil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>To date IBAMA has used AVHRR and GOES data and is now interested in
  using MODIS data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  investigators on this proposal have extensive experience with MODIS data and
  the validation of MODIS products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
  are also involved with international fire monitoring efforts that will help
  place this work within the context of the Global Observation of Forest Cover (GOFC)
  program and the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) Land Product
  Validation (LPV) subgroup.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="default-style">The proposed plan includes unique and innovative
  methods by coupling coincident MODIS and ASTER data with airborne campaigns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The soundness, logic, and practicality of the proposed techniques have
  been demonstrated through pilot work in Southern Africa (Justice et al., in
  press) and existing research (Eva and Lambin, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Leveraging off existing IBAMA, the MODIS-Fire team, GOFC, and CEOS
  creates a high likelihood of achieving the objectives. The proposal utilizes
  existing equipment, infrastructure, data sets, and analytical tools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The proposed work will integrate with the LBA program by providing
  validated fire and burn scar maps to the LBA team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We will look to existing and proposed work to provide high-resolution
  land cover products (namely, work of Skole et al, LBA team “LC-10”); which
  will augment the land cover maps available from MODIS.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="default-style">The training and education component includes annual
  workshops in Brazil on the use of remote sensing for fire and burnt area
  monitoring and management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  addition, the proposal requests funding for in-region graduate student (or
  students).&nbsp;<o:p>
