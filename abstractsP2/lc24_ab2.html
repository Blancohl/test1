  <b>LC-24&nbsp; Abstract</b></p>
  <p>

  <b>A Basin-Scale Econometric Model for Projecting Future Amazonian Landscapes</b></p>
  <p>Eustáquio J Reis, IPEA/DIMAC (SA-PI)<br>
                                       Robert T. Walker, Michigan State University (US-PI) </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The proposed project seeks to develop a basin-scale
  econometric model for use in predicting land cover change scenarios in the
  Amazon basin.&nbsp; It will combine the region-scale of the GIS-based
  approach, with the behavioral rigor of the micro-level studies, in
  constructing a model that can predict land cover change over large areas with
  theoretical grounding, and empirical testing.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Three key issues will be addressed in the research in
  order to improve upon existing aggregate models for the Amazon.&nbsp; First,
  the model will not only incorporate economic theory for individual decisions,
  but also theory related to macro-level effects on land cover, as generated by
  state policies. Second, the model will account for spatial heterogeneity in
  the determinants of land use across the region by drawing on empirical
  research from multiple sites with contrasting settlement histories. And third,
  in both estimation of the effects of land-cover drivers and landscape
  projections, “endogenous” road construction following initial
  deforestation along major roads will be accounted for.&nbsp; These three
  innovations will allow an improved econometric model from which coefficients
  used in projections are based on observed historical deforestation in the
  basin. This empirical approach also facilitates the evaluation of confidence
  intervals for coefficients and comparison of model predictions with
  out-of-sample new data.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The proposed research thus addresses the LBA-ECO theme
  “land cover and land use change.” <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">By focusing on construction of an econometric statistical
  model of deforestation for the entire Amazon basin, this analysis seeks to
  help answer the second-tier NASA research question (F2): <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">“What changes are occurring in the global land cover
  and land use, and what are their causes?” <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It also seeks to address the related question (LC-Q1):&nbsp;
  “What are the rates and mechanisms of forest conversion to agricultural land
  uses, and what is the relative importance of these land uses?”&nbsp; In
  addressing such questions, the proposed project will provide projections of
  land use, with error bounds, contributing to understanding of future land-use
  and vegetative-cover scenarios for the Amazon basin. That could also prove of
  value for second-tier issues such as (P5) regarding the “reliability of
  models predicting future atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and
  methane.”&nbsp; The research will involve key informant interviews at
  several field sites to address the issue of road endogeneity, satellite image
  interpretation to provide data for dependent variables that will be used in
  statistical modeling, and specification and estimation of an econometric
  model.&nbsp; In addition, an explicitly spatial model will be developed for
  implementation in the Santarém/Tapajos sub-region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p>
