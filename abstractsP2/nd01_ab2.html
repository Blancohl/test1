Role of Environment and Substrate Composition in Modifying Soil Nutrient Cycling
and Forest Regeneration</b></p>

<p class="default-style">We propose an integrated remote sensing and
field-based examination of the causes and biogeochemical consequences of
regional land-cover change within the Arc of Deforestation in the southern
Amazon Basin. Research components include field observations, regional
synthesis, and multiresolution studies, with a major focus on remote sensing.&nbsp;
We will refine the standardized methods we developed during LBA-ECO Phase I for
consistent mapping of regional land-cover conversion through time. The
techniques will be expanded to include diverse environmental variation, and new
methods will be developed to map forest degraded by logging, fire, and
fragmentation.&nbsp; These remote sensing products will be combined with
ancillary data sets and field measurements to evaluate the relative importance
of environmental and human controls on patterns of land-cover change, and the
consequences of land-cover change for vegetation growth and succession and for
soil and stream biogeochemistry. &nbsp;Our previous research in Rondônia shows
that variations in topography and rock type generate significant gradients in
natural soil fertility and stream nutrient concentrations across the state.&nbsp;
Roads and urban networks, superimposed on this natural variation, constrain or
accelerate land-cover conversion and have important consequences for human
impacts on stream biogeochemistry.</p>
<p class="default-style">Our questions represent diverse
academic disciplines, but all aim to combine remote sensing with field
measurements to develop an integrated understanding of regional patterns in
land-cover change and its biogeochemical consequences.&nbsp; In addition to
producing a variety of remote sensing products to monitor land-cover change, we
will address the following questions:&nbsp; How can remote sensing methods be
combined with field measurements to better quantify changes in vegetation
community structure due to selective logging, and how extensive are those
changes?&nbsp; What are the topographic and geologic determinants of soil
mineralogy and fertility across the state of Rondônia, and how does this
natural variation in soil type constrain or promote land-cover conversion?&nbsp;
Finally, how do vegetation conversion and the evolving human settlement system
affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemistry and over what scales do these
drivers operate?<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">Our research approach can be
divided into three intersecting phases: 1) mapping and monitoring a suite of
land-cover changes; 2) evaluation of the natural and human drivers of forest
conversion; and 3) measurement of the impacts of those changes on forest
structure in selectively logged areas and on soil and stream biogeochemistry in
areas converted to pasture.&nbsp; The research will be conducted in the
Brazilian states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso, which show significant intra- and
interstate variations in deforestation rates, selective logging intensity, urban
development, and environmental gradients.&nbsp; An important aspect of the
project is a dedication to exchange research methods and techniques in the LBA/Amazon
research community, most intensively among Imazon, INPE, and UCSB.&nbsp;
Institutional exchanges will provide an opportunity for intensive training, data
sharing and research collaboration among U.S. and Brazilian participants.<o:p>
