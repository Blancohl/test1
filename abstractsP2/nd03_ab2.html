<p class="default-style" s>Deforestation in the
Amazon has the potential to alter the biogeochemistry of carbon and major
nutrients over large regions and to alter the movements of these materials among
adjoining ecosystems. Small streams dominate the total length of stream channels
in the landscape. They receive material from adjacent uplands and contribute
material to larger rivers. Because of their position, small streams and their
associated riparian zones thus play a key role in the landscape as links and
regulators of material fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and larger rivers
of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p class="default-style">Our goal is to develop an
understanding of how C and nutrients are transformed as water moves from uplands
through small streams to larger rivers in forested and deforested landscapes of
the Amazon. We will do this by: 1) focusing on carbon and nutrient
transformations in riparian zones and small stream channels--key points in the
landscape where these transformations are potentially of major importance but
very poorly known in tropical landscapes; 2) comparing these transformations in
drainage basins with forest and pasture land use and in streams of different
sizes, and; 3) coupling our process level work with information on land use and
riparian zone structure derived from remote sensing and models of stream channel
processing to predict transfers of organic matter and nutrients to larger rivers
in stream networks. The work will be focused in central Rondônia.</p>
<p class="default-style">In riparian
zones, we will determine the spatial variability of water entering and leaving
the riparian zones of forest and pasture streams of different sizes using
surveys of ground water characteristics. We will use 15N, nutrient
and conservative tracer additions to identify key processes and rates of
transformation in the groundwater of forest and pasture riparian zones.</p>
<p class="default-style">In stream
channels, we will use 15N tracer additions in forest and pasture
streams to determine key processes and rates of transformation, and production
and consumption of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon. We
will use the isotopes of 13C in dissolved organic carbon and
dissolved inorganic carbon and different particulate and dissolved constituents
to trace the sources of C to streams. We will extend this work to a regional
basis with surveys of nutrients and organic matter in 2-5th order
streams in forest and pasture land use on different soil types within the
region.</p>
<p class="default-style">At the regional
scale, satellite images will be used to classify areas to land use type,
riparian zone type and extent and length of stream channels of different stream
orders in forest and pasture. A multi-compartment stream biogeochemistry model
will be used to predict the transformations of C and N and their downstream
transport in streams of different sizes and land uses. We will integrate
watershed land use area and stream channel length in different land use types to
estimate regional impacts of land use change on biogeochemical cycles in small
streams and transport from small streams to larger rivers.</p>
<p class="default-style">This project will bring
together studies of land and water biogeochemistry and link them together with
an understanding of changes in processes that occur in key points in the
landscape. It will provide new information on how these processes change when
forest is replaced by pasture and it will put this information in a framework to
predict the effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on stream water quality and
C and nutrient transport to larger rivers.</p>
