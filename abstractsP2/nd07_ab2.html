<p class="default-style"><b>Effects of Land Use Changes on
the Functioning of Soils and Watersheds of Central Brazil Savannas: Impacts on
Nutrient and Carbon Cycles and Trace Gas Exchange<o:p>
 </b>
</o:p>
</p>
Mercedes M.C. Bustamante, UnB (SA-PI)<br>
                                       Richard G. Zepp, US EPA (US-PI)
<p class="default-style">We propose
to assess the effects of land use on: 1) the stocks and cycling rates of carbon
and nutrient cycling and related ancillary data (microbial biomass; soil
temperature, soil moisture, etc.); 2) soil-atmosphere fluxes of trace carbon and
nitrogen gases (CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, and NO); and 3) the composition and quantity
of nutrients and organic matter entering small streams via gallery forests. Our
research will focus on the following LBA research questions:</p>
CD–Q3a How do pools and fluxes of carbon and nutrients (in soils) of pasture/cropland change
over time and what factors determine carbon gain or loss?
<p class="default-style">TG-Q1 How are fluxes of trace gases and aerosols
between ecosystems (both upland and wetland) and the atmosphere of Amazônia
affected by land cover and land use change?
</p>
<p class="default-style">TG-Q2 What is the (climatically driven) seasonal and
inter-annual variability of trace gas and aerosol fluxes between the atmosphere
and different land use and land cover types?<o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">TG-Q3 Are losses and gains of carbon from Amazônian
ecosystems in forms other than carbon dioxide (e.g. carbon monoxide, methane,
volatile organic carbon, organic aerosol) of sufficient magnitude to influence
ecosystem carbon balance?<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">ND–Q1 How do stocks, cycling rates and budgets of
carbon and important elements nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
magnesium, and aluminum change under different land covers and land uses?<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">ND–Q4 How do changes in land use and climate alter
the stocks, processes and fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic matter,
nutrients, and trace gases from the uplands across the riparian zones and
floodplains and down the channels of river corridors?<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="default-style">We will
quantify rates of carbon and nutrient cycling and characterize soil organic
matter (SOM) and litter quality at both native and converted sites.&nbsp; We
plan to study the influence of fertilization and management practices (tillage,
no-tillage, cover crops, irrigation) on the carbon balance in pastures and
cropland.&nbsp; These experiments will include measurements of soil-atmosphere
fluxes of trace carbon and nitrogen gases (CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, NO), different SOM
fractions, litter quality, N cycling, and P fractions.&nbsp; To provide data and
relationships needed for regional trace gas and nutrient dynamics models we will
measure relevant ancillary data, including changes in soil temperature,
moisture, incident solar radiation, and the size and diversity of the soil
microbial community.&nbsp; To assess land use changes on gallery forests and
aquatic systems, streams that drain watersheds dominated by natural vegetation,
agriculture, and urban lands, will be selected.&nbsp; Chemical analyses of water
collected from surface runoff collectors, soil lysimeters, and groundwater
piezometer located within the gallery forest, and directly from the stream, will
be used to evaluate nutrient cycling within the forest buffers and the stream.
The goal will be to develop predictive models that relate the landscape metrics,
determined by analysis of spatial land cover databases, to the various chemical
and physical parameters.</p>

<p class="default-style">Our
native study sites will continue to include native cerrado stricto sensu and
campo sujo and will expand to include gallery forests.&nbsp; Added converted
Cerrado sites will include croplands and recently converted pastures.&nbsp;
Sites include the research and ecological reserve operated by the Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) 
and located 35 km south of Brasília D.F (15o 56’ S, 47o 51’ W) and pasture
sites located at the Fazenda Rio de Janeiro (15° 14’ S, 47° 42’ W)
northwest of Brasilia.&nbsp;</p>
