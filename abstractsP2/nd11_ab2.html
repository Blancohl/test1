<p class="MsoNormal">Research Approach<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our major focus will be on the questions “What are the
impacts of conventional and reduced impact logging on above and belowground
carbon and nutrient stocks and water and nutrient fluxes and how do these
impacts change over time following the logging?” Answering these carbon and
nutrient dynamics science questions will require ground-based biogeochemical
studies and the enhancement and use of currently available GIS techniques.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The specific goals of our
project are to: (1) Measure existing forest biomass (carbon) and nutrient stocks
and validate available models for estimating forest biomass. (2) Quantify the
impact of soil texture and fertility gradients on above and belowground C and
nutrient stocks in local forests, and (3) Measure the impact of conventional
(CL) versus reduced impact logging (RIL) on C dynamics. If time and funds
permit, we will also obtain measurements on the quantity and composition of
sediment, nutrients, water and organic matter entering first order streams.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We will estimate aboveground live biomass in primary forest
using four alternative allometric equations that were calculated for moist
tropical forest trees and fine-tune these estimates with destructive sampling
and direct measurements of trees in similar forests and soils at settlement
sites adjacent to primary forest on our site. Because settlers completely clear
the forest for agriculture on 20-30% of their land, we will be able to use
destructive harvests for all DBH size classes and then estimate the biomass
contribution of bole extensions belowground. We will also use the plots on
settlements to directly measure vine and epiphyte biomass and relate this to
aboveground tree biomass.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We propose to quantify the
impact of soil texture and fertility gradients on above and belowground C and
nutrient stocks in local forests. We will use an empirical and a modeling
approach to examine the relationship of soil texture, especially clay content,
to patterns in above and belowground C and nutrient pools. Our site is
characterized by an Oxisol-Ultisol-Entisol association that is commonly found
across the Amazon basin. To examine the role of texture in greater detail, and
to test mechanisms by which texture influences the biogeochemistry of moist
lowland tropical forests, we will use the Century model to simulate the forest
on the different soil textural classes at our site. Our data will contribute
significantly to the robustness and reliability of existing allometric equations
for forest biomass across the Amazon.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify">In
addition, our site has a 10 year chronosequence of selective, conventional (CL)
and reduced impact logging (RIL). We propose to evaluate the We will use the
data from the studies mentioned above to measure the impact of CL and RIL on
above and belowground C and nutrient dynamics. The removal of trees inevitably
leads to nutrient export from the forest ecosystem. It is unclear to what extent
nutrients are distributed among topsoil, subsoil, litter layer, standing biomass
and streams by selective logging. We will collaborate with Richey et al. (CD-06)
to link our measurements of C and nutrient flows to first order streams with
local rivers. We are collaborating with Asner et al (LC-13) to evaluate canopy
damage and the hyperspectral signatures of various stages in the selective
logging chronosequence – from primary forest to the logging event to regrowth.
Our links with work in CD-06 and LC 13 will contribute to the assessments of the
impacts of selective logging on carbon management at the basin scale.</p>
