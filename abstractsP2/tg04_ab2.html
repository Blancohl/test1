<p class="default-style" style="margin-right:-.75in;text-indent:.5in">We propose
to continue studies of the rates and mechanisms of processes controlling carbon
dioxide and trace gas fluxes at old growth forest and selectively-logged forest
sites in the Tapajos National Forest and at pasture sites south of Santarém,
Pará, Brazil using a unique suite of state-of-the-art radon and stable isotope
measurements. The continuing work is fully integrated with LBA-ECO tower eddy
covariance flux, forest canopy gas inventory and soil gas flux studies led by
Keller et al. (TG-07), Goulden and Rocha (CD-04), and Wofsy et al. (CD-10). In
addition, we propose to make tower and portable field radon measurements that
will contribute to larger scale studies of gas transport processes associated
with the development of nocturnal and convective boundary layers led by
Fitzjarrald and Moraes (CD-03) and other LBA-ECO Science Team members. Brazilian
collaborators and students lead or are involved in many aspects of the proposed
project. All of the proposed radon-222 and stable isotope measurements will be
made in Brazil except for limited laboratory intercalibration studies that are
essential for achieving maximum analytical accuracy. The proposed research will
quantitatively address two theme areas in LBA-ECO: Carbon Dynamics and Trace Gas
and Aerosol Fluxes. The proposed work is focused on four primary objectives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="default-style">Quantification of net CO2 and trace gas exchange rates
    between the atmosphere and old growth and selectively logged forests and
    pastures utilizing tower and soil flux radon-222 measurements. Direct
    comparison of exchange rates from radon versus eddy covariance rates using
    the same canopy gas inventory measurements.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="default-style">Radon tracing of periodic and spatially inhomogeneous
    vertical and horizontal gas transport on a regional scale up to the top of
    the convective boundary layer (CBL) including quantification of nocturnal
    and CBL vertical scales and inhomogeneity and initial investigations of
    horizontal air drainage from the FLONA Tapajos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p class="default-style">Quantification of CO2 and trace gas soil fluxes and
    production/consumption rates versus height within the forest canopy using
    measured radon-222 flux divergence. Direct comparison of these rates with
    results from auto-chamber soil flux and canopy respiration rate
    measurements.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="default-style">Utilization of methane canopy inventory, soil flux and
    d13C-CH4 measurements to distinguish the sources, canopy height source
    distribution, and net flux of methane from soils and dispersed forest
    sources to the atmosphere.</li>
</ol>
<p class="default-style">All of the proposed research is relevant to the broad
LBA-ECO science question: How do tropical forest conversion, re-growth, and
selective logging, influence carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas
fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable land use in Amazônia. Completion of
the objectives should help to answer Questions CD-Q1 and CD-Q3b under the Carbon
Dynamics theme and Questions TG-Q1 and TG-Q3 under the Trace Gas and Aerosol
Flux theme.</p>
