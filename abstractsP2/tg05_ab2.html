    <p>The Amazon region includes the largest remaining tropical forest
    ecosystem on Earth.&nbsp; Despite the Amazon’s potential importance for
    climate regulation, the precise pattern of a terrestrial sources and sinks
    for CO2 and other “greenhouse gas” compounds like methane remain
    uncertain for the region.&nbsp; These large gaps in our knowledge still
    exist to a great degree because many impacts of land cover change and
    geochemical controls related to surface hydrology have not been understood
    in adequate detail to determine precise regional fluxes for biogenic trace
    gases.&nbsp; Therefore, the fundamental approach we propose for LBA-ECO II
    research involves integrated studies and predictive modeling for Amazon
    carbon, water, and nutrient cycles using a regional ecosystem model called
    NASA-CASA (Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach), which has been uniquely
    developed and applied using satellite data drivers as a component of the
    NASA LBA-ECO I program.&nbsp; Our proposed work thereby builds upon over
    four years of coordinated data assimilation and model development, as part
    of the LBA Science Team.&nbsp; The research plan we now propose is designed
    to extend the value of new LBA site (tower and small plot flux) data and
    remote sensing products by up-scaling with NASA-CASA to the regional level
    using a variety of different land cover products available for the Amazon
    region.&nbsp; In this manner, we propose to make new linkages in LBA-ECO
    project science between site-based investigation and regional scale modeling
    and remote sensing.       </p>
    <p>A unique aspect of our study approach is to treat land cover
    inputs to our ecosystem carbon modeling as variable &nbsp;according to time,
    spatial scale, and spatial resolution.&nbsp; In the proposed research plan,
    the NASA-CASA ecosystem model will make a series of simulation runs using
    multiple sequences of land cover change for the entire Amazon regional
    extent.&nbsp; The simulations will include the following land cover/land use
    class settings&nbsp; -- moist primary forest, dry primary forest,
    drought-deciduous forest, savanna, disturbed (burned), secondary forest,
    pasture, and annual crop.&nbsp; Nominal spatial resolution for hydro-meteorologic
    inputs to our LBA regional simulations will be 8x8 km pixel size.&nbsp; The
    percentage cover-weighted results from these individual model runs for land
    cover change sequences will be aggregated to reconstruct a history of
    regional heterogeneity in Amazon ecosystem dynamics.&nbsp; Trace gas fluxes
    (e.g., CO2, N2O) will be weighted by land cover change frequency
    distributions derived from the highest spatial resolution data available
    (e.g., from MODIS and Landsat sensors) for the entire region and for
    selected smaller areas around intensive LBA studies.&nbsp; High resolution
    (&lt; 1-km) land cover images for 'footprint' areas of LBA tower sites will
    be used to define the proportions of each land cover class with which to
    weight ecosystem model estimates and validate against measured tower fluxes
    of carbon and water exchange.&nbsp; Particular emphasis will be placed on
    Tapajós National Forest (TNF) tower sites, where our Brazilian
    co-investigators are actively making field measurements of energy, water,
    and carbon exchange, which are vital to ecosystem model evaluation.    </p>
    <p>A second integrative aspect of this study will be to extend
    NASA-CASA model predictions of carbon and trace gas fluxes to (seasonally)
    inundated areas of the region.&nbsp; Through close collaboration with other
    LBA investigator teams whose studies have developed or used radar remote
    sensing products or surface water models, we will adapt our CASA model to
    include Amazon mainstem and floodplain dynamics, with focus on up-scaling
    wetland ecosystem methane and CO2&nbsp; emission fluxes.&nbsp; At the
    smaller scale of the TNF watershed, we will complete the development of a
    new parameterization scheme within the NASA-CASA model for coupling a
    surface water routing model called HYDRA (Univ. Wisconsin), and validating
    simulations of surface water flow against measured flow and dissolved carbon
    chemistry of the Rio Moju discharge network from the TNF.     </p>
