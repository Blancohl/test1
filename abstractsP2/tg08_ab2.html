<p class="default-style" style="text-indent:.5in">Intensification of agriculture
is emerging as a major issue in the Amazon Basin because it is likely to have
broad-scale biological and biogeochemical effects.&nbsp; We propose to study the
biogeochemical effects of the intensification of pasture agriculture and the
conversion of pasture to soybean monoculture.&nbsp; To do this we have
established a series of large (40m x 40m) experimental plots on a ranch in Rondônia
where we have studied pasture biogeochemistry for the past decade.&nbsp; Through
a range of experimental treatments and a regional survey, we are developing a
process-level understanding of how biogeochemical phenomena such as soil carbon
balance, trace gas emissions and leaching losses of plant nutrients are affected
by changes in agricultural land use.&nbsp; We will collaborate with other LBA
investigators to scale site-specific data to the whole Basin.</p>
