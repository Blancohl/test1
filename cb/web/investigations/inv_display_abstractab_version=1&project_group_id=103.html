<span class="default-style"><h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#0033CC">Project Synopsis<!--mstheme--></font></h4><br><br><p>Purpose of the Study<br><br><p><font size="2">The goal of the proposed research is to answer the question: </font><br><br><p><font size="2"> <b>What is the<br><br>influence of land-cover change on the streamflow of Amazonian river basins with<br><br>areas of approximately 10,000 km<sup>2 </sup>?</b><br><br></font><br><br><p><font size="2">Since the effects of land–cover change at this ‘mesoscale’ interact<br><br>with the influence of the other major controlling variables, climate and basin<br><br>size, this question needs to be answered by accomplishing subsidiary tasks,<br><br>which are:<br><br><br></font><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li><font size="2">to quantify the influence of both climate and land-cover change on river<br><br>    flow in Amazonian basins with areas of approximately 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>;</font></li><br><br>  <li><font size="2">to define the range of basin size over which land use, with its own<br><br>    characteristic nature and scale in Amazonia, affects the hydrology of<br><br>    rivers; and</font></li><br><br>  <li><font size="2">to understand processes governing those influences.<br><br><br>    </font></li><br><br></ol><br><br><font size="2"><br><br>The results will be expressed in the form of a mathematical model, checked<br><br>against the response of river flow in the State of Rondônia, Brazil, and driven<br><br>by measurements of rainfall, energy sources, and terrain characteristics,<br><br>derived initially from ground-based measurements and eventually from satellites.<br><br>The model will be applicable to mesoscale basins in other physiographic regions<br><br>of the Amazon Basin, in which our research group has some field experience. The<br><br>purpose of the model is to assist in interpreting and generalizing from field<br><br>data and in understanding the processes by which climate and land-cover, along<br><br>with terrain characteristics, affect hydrologic response at the river-basin<br><br>scale. That understanding will be formalized through systematic computational<br><br>experiments, and checked against river discharges gauged by the Brazilian<br><br>hydrometric agency ANEEL. The empirical part of the study will define current<br><br>and recent effects of climate fluctuation and land use on river flow. The<br><br>intended level of understanding and modeling of river flows and basin hydrology<br><br>will facilitate sustainable management of water and land resources in heavily<br><br>exploited regions.<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><b><font size="2">Methodology</font></b><br><br><p><font size="2">The rare opportunity exists in the state of Rondônia for a model-based<br><br>comparison of land-use effects on the hydrology of river basins varying from a<br><br>few hundred to 60,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Four subparallel, mesoscale basins: the<br><br>Jaci-paraná, Candeias, Jamari, and Ji-Paraná, run north to join the R. Madeira,<br><br>one of the major tributaries of the Amazon (Figure 1). These basins have been<br><br>gauged by the Brazilian hydrometric agency, ANEEL, for periods ranging up to<br><br>about 20 years. Their regional geology, soils, rainfall climates, and primary<br><br>vegetation covers (<i>floresta aberta</i>) are similar, but because the pattern<br><br>of land-use in the region is driven by the alignment of a major road, BR-364,<br><br>the approximate proportions of the basins that have been deforested at some time<br><br>between 1974 and 1996 are: essentially zero for the Jaci-paraná; <5% in the<br><br>Candeias; 51% for the Jamari, and 47% for the Ji-Paraná. Gauged tributary basins<br><br>within the Jamari and Ji-Paraná basins (Figure 1) represent a broader range of<br><br>deforestation, ranging up to 70%. The shaded zone in Figure 1 indicates the zone<br><br>of widespread deforestation that has occurred at some time before 1996.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">It is not possible in such a large area and dynamic land-use situation to<br><br>perform a hydrologic experiment of the kind conducted in studies of land-use<br><br>effects in "paired watersheds". Important results on the microscale<br><br>response of forest and pasture in Rondônia will result from such a microscale<br><br>basin study and associated hydrometeorological observations to be conducted by a<br><br>Brazilian, British, and Dutch contingent in LBA. We have communicated closely<br><br>with this group throughout our planning, and hope to use results from their<br><br>towers and other sites to refine our energy and water balance computations.<br><br>However, that study does not speak to the mesoscale question concerning<br><br>river-basin response, outlined above.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">In the absence of a controlled hydrologic experiment, we intend to define the<br><br>mesoscale land-use signal through a formal, model-based comparison of the<br><br>hydrologic response of basins with differing extents and histories of land-cover<br><br>change during the period of river gauging. We will base our modeling on field<br><br>measurements by ourselves and others to represent explicitly the effects of land<br><br>cover and other variables (mainly soil, topography, and channel network form) on<br><br>the physical processes of the hydrologic cycle (evaporation, infiltration,<br><br>soil-moisture storage, groundwater storage, subsurface flow, streamflow, and<br><br>floodplain inundation). At the mesoscale, these processes must be integrated to<br><br>a coarse-grained resolution, and this will be the task on which we will<br><br>concentrate. We will do this by characterizing relatively homogeneous Hydrologic<br><br>Response Units (HRUs) of approximately 10-100 km<sup>2</sup> each using (1)<br><br>previously mapped and satellite-based information on terrain characteristics,<br><br>interpreted on the basis of our sample field transects of topography, depth to<br><br>bedrock and water tables, and subsurface hydrologic properties; (2) isotopic and<br><br>chemical tracing of runoff from HRUs; and (3) numerical modeling, and routing of<br><br>the predicted runoff to stream gauges currently maintained by ANEEL.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">After comparing the results of the (un-calibrated) model with rainfall and<br><br>streamflow data from the gauges shown in Figure 1, we will conduct a set of<br><br>computational experiments to analyze systematically the influence of climate and<br><br>land use on the hydrologic functioning of mesoscale basins under a range of<br><br>conditions that is widespread in the heavily exploited portion of the Amazon Basin. Our emphasis will be on creating a general, process-based understanding<br><br>of the land-use signal on both the quickflow that generates floods and<br><br>transports bioactive materials into streams, and the delayed flow that sustains<br><br>water supplies and aquatic ecosystems, and reflects regional patterns of<br><br>evaporation, primary production, soil moisture, and groundwater recharge. Both<br><br>our systematic field surveys of variability and pattern in terrain<br><br>characteristics and our modeling will also facilitate the interpretation of<br><br>macroscale, coarser-grained approaches to observing and modeling the entire<br><br>Amazon Basin.<br><br><br><br><br><p><img border="1" src="../../../lbahydromet/about/abstracts/sh02/dunne.gif" align="left" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="539"><p><br><br><br><br><p><font size="1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Map of<br><br>the four mesoscale rivers to be used in the study.
