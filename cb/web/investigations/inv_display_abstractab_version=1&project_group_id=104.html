<span class="default-style"><p><font size="2">Precipitation is an essential component<br><br>of the hydrological cycle and probably is the most important climatic variable<br><br>of the Amazonian water balance. Accurately estimating precipitation rates<br><br>in the Amazon Basin has been a significant challenge, because it has very<br><br>few rain gauges and receives large amounts of rainfall. Willmott et<br><br>al. (1994) estimates that, for the region’s gauge density (fewer than<br><br>20 stations per 106 km2), estimates of precipitation<br><br>can be in error by as much as 100 to 700 mm/yr. The low rain gauge density is also<br><br>reflected in the quality of studies that use rainfall as input data.<br><br>For example, in a simulation study of Amazonian river discharge as a function<br><br>of land cover and climatic conditions, Costa and Foley (1997) showed that<br><br>uncertainties in the rainfall data in western Amazon basin (where rain<br><br>gauge density is lower) was one of the most important factors that contributed<br><br>to errors in the simulated discharges, even at locations thousands of kilometers<br><br>downstream.</font><br><br><br><br><p><font size="2">In order to minimize the gauge density<br><br>problem, satellite measurements and numerical models have been widely used<br><br>in recent years. The rainfall estimates provided by the assimilation of<br><br>the results of numerical weather prediction models present several problems,<br><br>including low resolution and undulations associated with the spectral representation<br><br>of topography in such models (Costa and Foley, 1998). On the other hand,<br><br>satellite estimates can have high resolution, and accuracy depends on<br><br>the technique and calibration used. The most common satellite rainfall<br><br>estimation techniques rely on cloud top temperature infrared (IR) measurements<br><br>only (Martin et al., 1990), microwave (MW) measurements (Negri et<br><br>al., 1994) or on the combination of IR and MW (Vicente, 1994). The<br><br>IR-only technique is the most indirect approach because it relies on the<br><br>statistical interpretation of cloud top temperature. However it provides<br><br>very high temporal resolution for the estimates since the temperature measurements<br><br>are made by a satellite on a geosynchronous orbit. The MW technique provides<br><br>the most accurate measurement of instantaneous rainfall rates, because<br><br>the precipitation amounts are physically related to the cloud MW radiation<br><br>emission and scattering. However, this technique can only provide estimates<br><br>a few times a day over a narrow area because it relies on measurements<br><br>made from a polar orbiting satellite. The techniques that use both IR and<br><br>MW take advantage of the strengths of both measurements.</font><br><br><br><br><p><font size="2">In order to address the request of the<br><br>US National Weather Service (NWS) for an operational, automated and highly<br><br>accurate satellite rainfall estimation technique, G. Vicente and R. Scofield<br><br>(two of the authors of this proposal) have developed in recent years<br><br>at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a multi-spectral,<br><br>multi-channel satellite rainfall estimation technique (Vicente et al. 1998).<br><br>The technique evolved from a regression relationship between the GOES-8,<br><br>10.7 mm IR brightness temperature channel and surface rainfall rate derived<br><br>for the summer season on the US central Great Plains and the Gulf of Mexico<br><br>areas [Figure 1] (Vicente 1996). Further improvements led to the use<br><br>of model-generated relative humidity (RH) and precipitable water (PW) to<br><br>analyze the environmental moisture and to balance the rainfall amounts accordingly,<br><br>based on Scofield (1987). A refinement on the location of the precipitation<br><br>systems and screening of non-precipitating cloud is achieved by a detailed<br><br>analysis of spatial cloud top temperature gradient, cloud top growth, and<br><br>decaying rate, and by the use of the GOES-8 visible channel during daytime.<br><br>The technique has been running in real time for over three years and provides<br><br>1-hour and 3-hour total rainfall estimates every 30 minutes, 6-hour total<br><br>estimates at synoptic time and 24-hour estimates every 12:00 UTC. All estimates cover<br><br>the whole US territory with a spatial resolution of 4 by 4 km. The results<br><br>are available to Internet users through the NOAA Flash Flood Home Page<br><br>(URL: <a href="http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/arad/ht/ff/index.html" EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/ora/ht/ff</a>).<br><br>Statistical analyses made by the NOAA Satellite Analyses Branch (SAB)<br><br>have shown that the technique is accurate for operational use by the NWS<br><br>in 90% of the cases where the precipitation comes from cloud with warm<br><br>top and 70% of the cases where the precipitation comes from cold<br><br>cloud tops. Independent validation work by Vicente et al. (1998) has shown correlation coefficients varying from 0.52 to 0.76 for 1-hour<br><br>estimates at a 12 by 12 km grid size resolution. The results are better<br><br>when extended over longer time periods (3, 6 and 24 hours) and larger spatial<br><br>scales (48 by 48 km and 100 by 100 km grid size boxes).</font><br><br><br><br><p><font size="2">Parallel to the work of developing an operational<br><br>satellite rainfall estimation technique for the US territory, Vicente and<br><br>Scofield (1996) have started a simplified version to compute rainfall rate<br><br>in real time over Brazil. The Brazilian version of the technique has been running<br><br>for about two and half years and has many of the features of the US version.<br><br>However, it has not been calibrated or validated. The results are also<br><br>available in real time as an experimental product on the NOAA Flash Flood<br><br>Home page mentioned above (see Precipitation over South America). In this<br><br>proposal, we intend to expand this version not only to assimilate most<br><br>of what has been learned from the US version, but especially to calibrate<br><br>the parameterizations to the precipitation systems characteristic of Amazonia.<br><br>The deliverable of this research will provide satellite rainfall estimates<br><br>at spatial resolution of 4 by 4 Km and at time resolution of 30 minutes.<br><br>These precipitation measurements will be initially produced for 3 years,<br><br>but can be extended to the whole LBA experiment (6 years) or even longer,<br><br>subject to availability of funds. The proposed technique has better temporal<br><br>and spatial coverage than the TRMM satellite estimates, and knowledge of<br><br>diurnal variations of precipitation can be important for other parts of<br><br>the LBA project, especially LBA-Ecology. Several other research groups in<br><br>the LBA-Hydrometeorology and LBA-Ecology program will benefit from this<br><br>information, especially the modeling groups. We believe that the results<br><br>will allow the building of an LBA-long dataset of all components of the<br><br>surface water cycle.</font><br><br><br><br><p><font size="2">We will validate the technique on a daily<br><br>bases using gauge measurements provided by the LBA project, whenever it<br><br>is available and of good quality. Additional comparisons to the instantaneous<br><br>rainfall estimates provided by the TRMM will also be done for the times<br><br>and areas covered by the TRMM orbits. The statistics of the comparisons<br><br>on a region by region basis in Amazonia, as well as real-time estimates<br><br>for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours will be available daily through a specially dedicated<br><br>Web page to internet users during the whole duration of the project. The<br><br>digital data in GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display System) and in McIDAS<br><br>(Man computer Interactive Data Access System) will be available through<br><br>anonymous FTP to all investigators supported by the NASA LBA program from<br><br>our centers both in the U.S. (NOAA/NESDIS location at the World Weather Building<br><br>in Camp Springs, MD, USA) and in Brazil (Federal University of Viçosa,<br><br>MG, Brazil). An additional copy of the archived precipitation measurements<br><br>can be stored at the CPTEC LBA data center, if requested.</font><br><br><br><br><p><b><font size="2">Figure 1.</font></b><br><br><br><br><p><font size="2"><img border="0" src="../../../lbahydromet/about/abstracts/pc09/pc09a1.gif" WIDTH="495" HEIGHT="324"><br><br><br><br></font><br><br><br><br><p> <br><br><br><br><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b><font size="2">References</font></b><font size="2"> </font><br><br><br><br><p><font size="2">Costa, M.
