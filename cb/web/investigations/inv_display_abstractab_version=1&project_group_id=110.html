<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style">This cooperative project between California State<br><br>University-San Marcos (CSUSM) and the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (UFMT)<br><br>is designed to quantify the seasonal and interannual variations in the mass (CO2<br><br>and H2O vapor) energy exchange of an Amazonian tropical transitional forest. <br><br>Our study site is located near Sinop, Mato Grosso in a transitional (ecotonal)<br><br>region that separates the tropical rain forest and savanna.  Mass and<br><br>energy exchange is measured using tower-based eddy covariance over a mature,<br><br>undisturbed transitional tropical forest that is approximately 28-30 m tall. <br><br>Additional field measurements include leaf photosynthesis, soil CO2 efflux, soil<br><br>water content and water table depth, leaf area index, aboveground litter<br><br>production, litter decomposition, and micrometerology; data that are required<br><br>for interpreting the temporal variations forest mass and energy exchange. <br><br>Our previous LBA research significantly helped build capacity in South American<br><br>institutions by intensive training of UFMT undergraduate and graduate students<br><br>and faculty and the development of a M.Sc. degree program in environmental<br><br>physics that was recently approved by the Coordenacão de Aperfeicoamento de<br><br>Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES).  Our group is also beginning a<br><br>comparable research campaign in cattle pasture that is adjacent to the mature<br><br>forest stand and a proposed tower in a selectively-logged stand near our Sinop<br><br>site is pending approval from the USDA.  With these additional projects, we<br><br>hope to be able to develop a comprehensive picture of how land cover change and<br><br>land use alter mass and energy exchange of transitional tropical systems in<br><br>southern Amazonia, and ultimately, allow for collaborative assessments of how<br><br>land cover change and climate alter the mass and energy exchange of the Amazon Basin.</p></span>
