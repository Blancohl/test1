<span class="default-style"><p>Using longitudinal household survey data collected in 1990 and 1999, a 2000 community survey, a multi-resolution remote<br><br>    sensing time series, GIS coverage of resource potentials and endowments, and field verification and geodetic control data, we analyze<br><br>    the determinants of changes in LCLU at the plot, sector, and regional levels, and annual and decadal periods. </p><br><br>    <p> The fundamental research questions revolve around (a) the rates, and mechanisms of forest conversion to agricultural and urban uses, (b) the relative importance of<br><br>    exogenous and endogenous variables on these land uses, (c) the associated scale dependant drivers of LCLU dynamics and patterns<br><br>    operating across socio-economic and demographic, biophysical, and geographical domains; (d) rate and pattern of land conversion<br><br>    from forest to agricultural crops, pasture, secondary plant succession, and urbanization, as well as the rate and pattern of land<br><br>    abandonment at the farm level; and (e) plausible scenarios of future land cover change and their policy implications as assessed<br><br>    multi-level models that are responsive to multi-scale effects as well as spatial simulations of LCLU dynamics through a cellular automata<br><br>    approach.</p><br><br><br><br>    The survey periods and the assembled satellite time-series images serve as our reference dates that are integrated to define<br><br>    relationships through (1) multivariate logit models of LCLU for 1990, 1999, and for changes between those two survey periods; (2)<br><br>    satellite image classifications and change-detections of LULC dynamics, space-time trajectories of pixel histories, and pattern metrics of<br><br>    landscape organization to define LCLU composition and spatial structure; (3) LCLU simulation through cellular automata, informed by<br><br>    the satellite and multivariate models of LCLU change, to create spatial simulations of LULC dynamics; and (4) multi-level models to<br><br>    integrate variables and effects from multiple scales into an integrated model of LCLU dynamics to assess the scale<br><br>    dependence of variable interactions on LCLU patterns. <br><br>    <p> The analysis will be framed within a dynamic systems approach that emphasizes non-linear<br><br>    relationships, feedback, mechanisms, and critical thresholds in population-environment interactions.<br><br>    Theoretical foundations include principles involving the interplay of political ecology, human ecology, landscape ecology, and complexity theory.</p></span>
