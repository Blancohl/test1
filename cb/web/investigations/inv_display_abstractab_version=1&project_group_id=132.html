<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Stable<br><br>isotopes measured in atmospheric N2O and its sources have been<br><br>proposed as constraints for the global N2O budget. As yet, few<br><br>measurements exist to characterize the most important natural source of N2O,<br><br>tropical soils. We have developed field sampling and laboratory methods to<br><br>measure stable isotopes in N2O emitted from soils. Preliminary<br><br>measurements in tropical rain forest soils show considerable spatial variation<br><br>in the d15N of N2O emitted during the rainy season, both<br><br>regionally with soil type, and locally, within a few meters. We hypothesize that<br><br>the causes of spatial variability in N2O emissions reflect<br><br>differences in microbial processes and physical transport. The work proposed<br><br>here will test specific hypothesis to explain the causes of spatial variability<br><br>in N2O emissions.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p style="text-align:justify">We<br><br>will investigate variability in N2O isotopes at the Tapajos National<br><br>Forest sites in collaboration with investigators in the NASA LBA-ECO<br><br>program. Measurements of the isotopic signature of N2O emitted from<br><br>the soil surface using chambers will quantify local variability. Depth profiles<br><br>of N2O concentration and isotopic signature at the same sites,<br><br>combined with diffusion modeling, will test the hypothesis that the depth of<br><br>maximum N2O production controls both the flux and isotopic signature<br><br>of N2O. The increase of N2O in the nocturnal canopy layer<br><br>will be used to determine the spatially integrated emission rate and isotopic<br><br>signature of the soil source averaged over hundreds of square meters for<br><br>comparison with other scaling methods. Regional variability in the isotopic<br><br>signature of N2O emissions along a soil textural gradient will be<br><br>related to soil physical properties and nutrient status. To test the role of NO3-<br><br>in inhibiting N2O reduction, we will apply NO3-<br><br>fertilizer and measure the resulting change in the isotopic composition of<br><br>emitted N2O. To facilitate modeling of the microbial pathways of N2O<br><br>production and consumption, we will determine 15N isotopic<br><br>fractionation factors associated with denitrification (NO3-<br><br>to N2O and N2O to N2) using both jar<br><br>incubations and in situ addition of 15N<br><br>labeled NO3- under conditions of different soil water<br><br>content. Isotopic measurements of N2O in each case will be<br><br>supplemented with measurements of the amount and isotopic composition of<br><br>extractable nitrate, ammonium, and soil organic matter, estimates of soil gas<br><br>diffusion rates based on soil water content and physical structure, and<br><br>measurements of N2O and NO fluxes. The complete data sets will allow<br><br>us to test models of soil N and C cycling that predict N2O emissions<br><br>at regional to global scales. <o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Our<br><br>measurements will provide (1) better characterization of the isotopic signature<br><br>of this important N2O source for global budgets; (2) process-based understanding<br><br>linking the pathway of N2O production<br><br>(nitrification, denitrification) and the rate of loss (conversion to N2)<br><br>to the isotopic signature of emitted N2O; and (3) prediction of how<br><br>the isotopic signatures of tropical soil N2O emissions may change<br><br>following disturbance.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p> <o:p><br><br> <span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br><br></o:p><br><br></span></p><br><br><p>Background Information</p><br><br><p>The concentration of nitrous<br><br>oxide (N2O) has increased in the atmosphere since pre-industrial<br><br>times, and as a greenhouse gas, it contributes significantly to anthropogenic<br><br>radiative forcing. Its tropospheric mixing ratio is currently increasing<br><br>annually by about 0.25% per year. The reason for this increase seems to be<br><br>mostly dominated by agricultural intensification since 1500 AD, with a smaller<br><br>contribution from fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning and industrial<br><br>processes. Tropical forest soils are the largest natural source of N2O<br><br>to the atmosphere. Conversion of tropical forest for pasture and agricultural<br><br>use changes the rates of N2O emission from soils; however the net<br><br>effect of changing tropical land use on the N2O budget is poorly<br><br>known. The use of nitrogen fertilizers in tropical agricultural systems is<br><br>increasing rapidly, which will presumably increase tropical N2O<br><br>emissions in the future.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p>The use of stable isotopes<br><br>of N and O in atmospheric N2O and its sources has been proposed as a<br><br>way to better constrain the global N2O budget. In essence, the<br><br>overall tropospheric 15N  and 18O<br><br>value for nitrous oxide represents the balance between  N2O that is enriched in the heavy isotopes mixing down from the<br><br>stratosphere and oceanic and soil sources that are depleted in the heavy<br><br>isotopes.  The lightest isotopic<br><br>signatures for N2O<br><br>measured are from nitrogen- fertilized agricultural fields. We are hypothesizing<br><br>that increased N2O<br><br>sources from agriculture have resulted in a measurable decline of 15N  in<br><br>atmospheric N2O<br><br>over the past century (manuscript in preparation by Pérez et al.)<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p style="text-align:justify">The<br><br>majority of the available results for the isotopic signature of N2O<br><br>emitted from tropical soils in were measured in our laboratory, as part of the<br><br>PhD thesis of Tibisay Pérez. We have been able to explain the large spatial<br><br>variability in the isotopic signature of emissions as a combination of microbial<br><br>and physical processes influencing production and consumption of N2O<br><br>in soils (Pérez, Trumbore, Tyler, Davidson, and Keller, and Camargo, Isotopic<br><br>variability of N2O emissions from tropical forest soils, in press, Global<br><br>Biogeochemical Cycles). The work proposed for the new NSF grant will expand<br><br>on this previous work both looking at mechanisms of N2O<br><br>production and consumption in tropical forest, pasture and agricultural soils,<br><br>and attempting to do spatial averaging to estimate the global isotopic signature<br><br>of N2O emitted from tropical<br><br>soils.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p> <o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p>Proposed Measurement Sites and Types of Measurements</p><br><br><p style="text-align:justify">We<br><br>have proposed to work at two LBA field sites: <o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p style="text-align:justify">A<br><br>    primary tropical forest in the FLONA Tapajós, Brazil in collaboration with<br><br>Keller, Crill and de Mello, as well as pasture/agricultural fields in<br><br>collaboration with E.
