<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in">Drought is<br><br>changing moist tropical forests in Amazonia and elsewhere. Drought severity has<br><br>increased in these regions in association with El Niño events and may increase<br><br>further through global warming and land use change. The consequences of this<br><br>trend include potentially large effects on greenhouse gas emissions, tree<br><br>mortality, reproductive biology, biogeochemistry, and forest flammability.<br><br>During the 1998 El Niño episode, for example, approximately one third of Amazon<br><br>forests experienced depleted soil moisture and may have become susceptible to<br><br>fire. An integrated understanding of the responses of moist tropical forests to<br><br>severe drought has eluded the scientific community in part because intensive<br><br>field studies of episodic natural drought “experiments” are extremely<br><br>difficult.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="default-style" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in">In this<br><br>research, we continue a large-scale throughfall reduction experiment in an<br><br>Amazon forest. Predicted responses to a total of 5 years of<br><br>experimentally-induced drought and 2 years of release from drought stress will<br><br>be tested.  The study exploits the research infrastructure previously<br><br>established with NSF funding, including one-hectare control and treatment study<br><br>plots with canopy towers (8), catwalks (200 m), 12-m soil shafts (10) and<br><br>perimeter trenches (800 m). The plots were compared during a one-year<br><br>calibration period prior to treatment initiation.  Measurements include<br><br>stem and root sapflow, photosynthesis, leaf water potential, xylem cavitation,<br><br>fine root dynamics, soil water, canopy phenology, stem growth, stem respiration,<br><br>nutrient fluxes through the forest canopy, floor and soil, and soil fluxes of<br><br>CO2, CH4, N2O and NO. Beginning in 2000, throughfall has been partially excluded<br><br>from the treatment plot with 5,660 plastic panels that are installed in the<br><br>understory during the rainy season and removed during the dry season. <o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="default-style" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in">Forests<br><br>growing on deep, clay soils throughout much of Amazonia are buffered against the<br><br>effects of moderate droughts by the large amount of water stored in the rooting<br><br>profile.  But even mild drought elicits important forest responses. <br><br>After excluding 890 mm of throughfall in 2000 and 680 mm in 2001 from the<br><br>one-hectare treatment plot, several unanticipated forest responses were<br><br>documented that would have been very difficult to detect without a throughfall<br><br>manipulation of this magnitude.  <o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="default-style" style="text-indent:.5in">A reduction in soil methane<br><br>emissions relative to the control plot appeared within days of installation of<br><br>the exclusion panels. Surprisingly, a reduction in the growth of small tree<br><br>stems (<20 cm diameter) and a reduction in sap flow were the next major<br><br>treatment responses, appearing during the dry season of the first treatment<br><br>year.  This decline in stemwood production of nearly 1 Mg ha-1 yr-1 is<br><br>sufficient to offset the net carbon sink that has been reported for Amazon<br><br>forests.  The anticipated reduction of leaf area index (LAI) appeared only<br><br>during a second phase of drought in which deep soil moisture depletion began,<br><br>accompanied by declines in leaf water potential. Most of the LAI reduction was<br><br>caused by decreases in new leaf production instead of through increased leaf<br><br>shedding. Hence the stomatal closure provoked by mild drought stress was<br><br>manifested as slower stemwood growth; leaf production declined only as deep soil<br><br>moisture supplies were depleted. Estimates of NPP allocation to belowground<br><br>production are awaiting further analyses, but soil respiration measurements<br><br>indicate little total change.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="default-style" style="text-indent:.5in">During the next three years of<br><br>throughfall reduction, a third phase of drought responses is predicted in which<br><br>further soil moisture depletion provokes xylem embolism and the death of trees<br><br>and tree branches. Tree- and branchfall gaps will open the forest understory to<br><br>sunlight, but soil moisture deficits will limit the recovery processes that gap<br><br>formation usually triggers. Soil trace gas emissions will respond both to<br><br>changes in soil aeration and to changes in substrate availability caused by root<br><br>mortality. Movement of solutions through the soil profile will depend upon root<br><br>distributions, water content, and hydraulic conductivity.  Forest floor<br><br>accumulation combined with drought-induced reduction in leaf area index will<br><br>greatly increase forest flammability. After cessation of the throughfall<br><br>reduction treatment, persistent xylem damage in surviving large trees may<br><br>restrict the supply of water to canopy foliage and suppress photosynthesis for<br><br>years, while gaps are quickly filled by saplings and vegetative sprouts. <o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="default-style">           <br><br>These complex forest responses to drought, and the cessation of drought, will be<br><br>tested and modeled. Field measurements will be used to test and refine canopy<br><br>metabolism and forest models, improving our ability to simulate the responses of<br><br>moist tropical forests to severe drought, and the cessation of drought. This<br><br>experiment is the focus of 6 PhD dissertations, 2 MS theses, 5 undergraduate<br><br>theses, and numerous field ecology courses, and has been widely disseminated in<br><br>the popular media.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p></span>
