<p class="default-style"><strong>Multi-Scale Analysis of Inundation with Microwave and Optical Remote Sensing in the Amazon Basin:  Applications to Biogeochemical Measurements and Modeling</strong></p>

<span class="default-style"><p>We propose to conduct a multi-temporal, multi-scale, multi-sensor analysis of<br><br>inundation and wetland vegetation in the Amazon basin that will be linked to<br><br>biogeochemical measurement and modeling activities of LBA.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Our proposed remote sensing analyses will include optical (Landsat, AVHRR and EOS<br><br>sensors), passive microwave (SMMR/SSMI) and active microwave (SIRC, JERS, ERS, and<br><br>Radarsat) data to determine the temporally varying extent of inundation and associated<br><br>vegetation. We will (1) provide synoptic, seasonal mapping of inundation and wetland<br><br>vegetation structure for the Amazon basin; (2) incorporate the inundation and vegetation<br><br>data into a GIS-based database; and (3) apply results from our analyses of wetland<br><br>vegetation and inundation to related LBA studies of hydrological, ecological, and<br><br>biogeochemical processes.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>The expected time periods for recording an image useable for inundation analysis with<br><br>the different remote sensing instruments we propose to employ varies from days to months.<br><br>Based on an analysis of the spatial and temporal resolutions of the satellite sensors, we<br><br>have determined that data fusion amongst the instruments will be critical to insure<br><br>sufficient temporal coverage at the appropriate spatial scales. We anticipate that there<br><br>will be an inundation-mapping limit for typical rivers with contributing drainage basins<br><br>on the order of 1000-10,000 km2 when the flood conditions occur only for a week to a<br><br>month. Individual sites may be mappable above and below this limit, depending on the local<br><br>geomorphology and inundation hydrology.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>We anticipate results of our analyses to be important for LBA activities associated<br><br>with (1) methane and other trace gas emissions, (2) carbon dynamics of flooded forests,<br><br>(3) land use on flood plains, (4) regional hydrologic modeling, and (6) detection of<br><br>seasonal and inter-annual climate variability. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Implementation</p><br><br><br><br><p>Implementation of our activities will be done as follows: </p><br><br><br><br><p>Optical sensing - The most effective technique for tracking the zone of river-water<br><br>influence, in contrast to local-water influence, on wetland inundation is through the use<br><br>of optical data of sufficiently fine resolution. We will modify our current method for<br><br>suspended sediment analysis to incorporate data from the optical instruments expected<br><br>during LBA, i.e., Landsat 7, MODIS, and AVHRR. The optical image analysis will be limited<br><br>by access to sufficiently cloud and smoke-free data. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Active microwave sensors - We plan to use a multi-stage, hierarchical, rules-based<br><br>approach to delineate floodplain inundation and vegetation using a decision-tree model<br><br>which constructs a binary classification tree by recursively partitioning the training<br><br>data into increasingly homogeneous subsets. Inundation mapping at a fine scale (12.5 m to<br><br>100 m pixel spacing) will be carried out using a combination of JERS (LHH), Radarsat<br><br>(CHH), and ERS-2 (CVV) data. All these data will offer multi-temporal coverage of selected<br><br>regions; only Radarsat's ScanSAR is expected to provide multi-temporal coverage of the<br><br>whole Amazon basin during LBA. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Passive microwave sensors - Low-resolution sensors, such as the Scanning<br><br>Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI),<br><br>afford a synoptic view of the Amazon basin that complements finer-resolution SAR and<br><br>optical data. We have developed linear mixing models that incorporate the observed<br><br>microwave signature's major end members to estimate fractional inundation area. Data will<br><br>be obtained as 0.25° x 0.25° grid cells, and modal values for each 2-week period will be<br><br>used to determine inundation area </p><br><br><br><br><p>Field studies - Field surveys will be required at key LBA sites and selected<br><br>wetlands to validate our classifications and maps. These surveys will entail low altitude<br><br>videography and surface inspections from land and water. Geo-location of flight lines and<br><br>surface sites will be done with portable GPS units. Further, we will use information<br><br>obtained from the many hours of low altitude videography and field observations that we<br><br>have collected previously, as well as from published literature and from personal<br><br>contacts. To improve correlation between water levels and inundation extent in wetlands<br><br>distant from major rivers or gauging stations on rivers, we will install automatic water<br><br>level recorders. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Projected Schedule</p><br><br><br><br><p>During the first year, we will emphasize extension and validation of our microwave and<br><br>optical classification algorithms and assembly of mutli-temporal data sets from ERS,<br><br>Radarsat, JERS, Landsat and SSMI acquisitions. During the second and third years, we will<br><br>emphasize production and distribution of inundation and wetland vegetation maps to<br><br>relevant LBA projects and for our own complementary analyses. </p></span>
