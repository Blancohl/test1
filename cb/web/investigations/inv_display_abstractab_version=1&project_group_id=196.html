<span class="default-style"><p>           <br><br>In recent years severe droughts have<br><br>become common in tropical regions and may become more frequent in the<br><br>future.  Recent images of large,<br><br>extensive fires in the Amazonian and Cerrado regions remain fresh in our<br><br>memories.  Although characterized as a<br><br>biome with vegetation that explores deep soil to obtain nutrients and water,<br><br>the cerrado has suffered from land use change over a large geographic area<br><br>which has brought changes in the structure and function of this ecosystem.  Models that predict climate change show that<br><br>substitution of native vegetation by monocultures of pasture plants can change<br><br>precipitation patterns and the frequency dry periods in central Brazil.   These climatic changes can alter the<br><br>balance between woody plants with deep roots and herbaceous and grass species<br><br>with shallow roots.  The increase of<br><br>global temperatures and a concomitant decrease in precipitation may increase<br><br>the dominance of grasses to the detriment of deep-rooted woody vegetation in<br><br>the cerrado.  The cerrado vegetation has<br><br>the capacity to extract water and nutrients from deep soil layers during the<br><br>long dry season, which permits the foliage to continue to transpire.  Recharge of soil water after a long drought<br><br>is necessary for maintenance of the ecosystem. <br><br>During periods of prolonged drought, such as the last El Nino event of<br><br>1997/1998, this recharge of soil water did not occur, resulting in pronounced<br><br>hydrologic stress.  The vertical<br><br>distribution of carbon inputs by roots, and hence the stocks of soil carbon,<br><br>could be substantially affected.  In<br><br>this research project, we propose to test these predictions in the cerrado by<br><br>provoking an experimental reduction in rainfall in an area of natural cerrado<br><br>in the Reserva Ecológica do IBGE (protected from fire for more than 20 years)<br><br>using a constructed cover over the vegetation with a removable top.  To understand the effects of rainfall<br><br>exclusion on the structure and function of the vegetation, we are studying<br><br>canopy phenology, growth and mortality of woody plants, production and quality<br><br>of litter, nitrogen mineralization, microbial biomass, retranslocation of<br><br>nutrients by woody species, production and distribution of roots, and soil<br><br>respiration.  These measurements will be<br><br>correlated with measures of soil water, using the same methodology that we have<br><br>used to study soil water in deep soil shafts. <br><br>We will compare results from the experimental plot with an adjacent<br><br>control plot.   </p></span>
