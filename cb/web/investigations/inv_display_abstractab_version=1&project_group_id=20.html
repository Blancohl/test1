<span class="default-style"><p>Overview</p><br><br><br><br><p>The objective of this research is to understand the interactive effects of changes in<br><br>land-use and climate on 1) carbon storage and nutrient dynamics, including trace gas<br><br>fluxes, in terrestrial ecosystems and 2) the prospect for sustainable land-use in<br><br>Amazonia. <br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>The specific product of the research will be a set of coupled, hierarchically<br><br>structured models accessible through a common model framework. This framework will provide<br><br>the means for investigating our principal objectives. We shall consider the LBA region<br><br>within the context of two broad environmental conditions: 1) natural ecosystems where<br><br>perturbations in biogeochemical states are driven primarily by natural variability of<br><br>climate and fire, and 2) disturbance gradients that are induced by human land-use<br><br>activities and/or human-induced climate change.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>We will use our models of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, vegetation dynamics,<br><br>hydrology and land-use change. We will concentrate on model improvements to ensure<br><br>applicability of all models to the LBA study region. The ecosystem and hydrology models<br><br>will be driven by the physical climate; whereas, the land-use model will be driven by<br><br>biophysical, ecological, and economic constraints. The linked models will be incorporated<br><br>into a Geographic Information systems (GIS) context, accessing numerous data sets from LBA<br><br>or data layers housed at our institutions. We will evaluate model performance by<br><br>comparison and field measurements from LBA as well from published data sources. We will<br><br>use satellite remote sensing analysis as a means to evaluate the spatial and temporal<br><br>patterns of model performance at the regional scale. Finally, we will apply formal<br><br>statistical methods to characterize model uncertainty, as we apply this work to the<br><br>question of the human impacts on the Amazonian landscape.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Change from both natural and anthropogenic sources must be appropriately understood.<br><br>Therefore, we will focus on three objectives: </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>The natural pattern of variability in net primary production, respiration, nutrient<br><br>        availability, and the flux of trace gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the<br><br>        atmosphere</li><br><br>      <li>Human-altered land-cover and ecosystem distribution and condition</li><br><br>      <li>The associated changes in the pattern of net primary production, respiration, nutrient<br><br>        availability, and the flux of trace gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the<br><br>        atmosphere.</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>The Science Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>Our research effort links three Objectives. The First Objective focuses on the<br><br>biogeochemistry of terrestrial systems under the forcing of natural climate variability.<br><br>Among the topics of interest are the natural pattern of variability in net primary<br><br>production, respiration, nutrient availability, and the flux of trace gases between<br><br>terrestrial (including seasonally flooded) ecosystems and the atmosphere. Soil moisture<br><br>and inundation are also important components of this research because of their controls on<br><br>trace gas dynamics. In Objective Two, we address the problem of modeling the transient<br><br>dynamics of human-altered terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural systems, stages<br><br>of succession, and the combined forcing of various land-use and climate change patterns.<br><br>The Third Objective both supports and synthesizes the preceding Objectives. It provides a<br><br>Geographical Information System (GIS) framework for model development, evaluation, and<br><br>application. Within the model evaluation theme we will exploit remote sensing, using AVHRR<br><br>and when available, MODIS and MISR data from EOS AM-1, as well as formal error analysis<br><br>based upon spatial-temporal statistical techniques. We will use the linked model to<br><br>explore impacts of land-use and climate change scenarios on the biogeochemistry of the<br><br>region. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Key Tools</p><br><br><br><br><p>Amazonia contains some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, experiences<br><br>notable patterns of climate variability on seasonal to inter-annual time-scales, and is<br><br>undergoing significant changes in land-use. It is thus a region with important fluxes and<br><br>changes in fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and water. Regional-scale ecosystem modeling,<br><br>database development and remote sensing analysis will be important tools for evaluating<br><br>potential consequences of land-use change on the biogeochemistry in Amazonia. Key themes<br><br>and tools for our work will include modeling of natural and human-managed ecosystems,<br><br>remote sensing, GIS analysis, and large database assembly and dissemination. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Â <b></p><br><br><br><br><p>Analysis of Natural Ecological Systems</b><br><br><br>We have used the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model/Water Balance Model (TEM/WBM) to explore<br><br>seasonal and climatic variations in net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic<br><br>respiration (Rh), and net ecosystem production (NEP) for South America, North America, and<br><br>the globe. TEM is a process-based ecosystem simulation model that uses spatially<br><br>referenced information on climate, elevation, soils, and vegetation to make monthly<br><br>estimates of important carbon and nitrogen fluxes and pool sizes. A key feature of TEM is<br><br>that the carbon, water, and nitrogen cycles are closely coupled.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>In order to address the effect of climate variability and climate change, we are<br><br>developing a transient version of TEM and have used a preliminary version to explore the<br><br>response of terrestrial ecosystems to historical changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>concentration and climate in Amazonia, the conterminous United States, high latitude<br><br>ecosystems, and the globe (see also DNDC discussion in the next subsection (i.e., III.<br><br>2)). Inter-annual variations of modeled NPP in Amazonia were primarily associated with<br><br>inter-annual variations of precipitation. Inter-annual variations in modeled Rh were<br><br>smaller and connected mainly with inter-annual variations of temperature. The different<br><br>transient responses of these two carbon fluxes indicate that even under natural<br><br>conditions, the region sometimes acts as a sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and at<br><br>other times as a source. Within Amazonia, the spatial distribution of carbon sources and<br><br>sinks also apparently change from year to year. This behavior appears to be linked to the<br><br>physical climate through ENSO events.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Our earlier work in Amazonia showed the dependence of NPP on water availability. The<br><br>capability to model and understand changes in the Amazon regional water system is<br><br>important to studies of terrestrial productivity, and also the significant effects of<br><br>floodplain inundation on trace gas emissions. </p><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Studies of Managed and Disturbed Ecosystems</b><br><br><br>We are currently developing a model for land-cover and land-use change. The model consists<br><br>of: 1) a land evaluation module that assesses the suitability and availability of land for<br><br>crops and pasture based on biophysical constraints such as climate, soil and topography,<br><br>and 2) a land-use module, GEOMOD, for simulating spatial patterns of land-use/land-cover<br><br>as well as the rates of change from landscape to regional scales based upon biophysical<br><br>factors and socio- economic factors (e.g., population density, land tenure system, timber<br><br>price). Algorithms within GEOMOD represent the principles of adjacency, dispersion,<br><br>regional heterogeneity, relative growth, energy efficiency, and resource quality.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Conversion of land to pasture and cropland has had a significant impact on the<br><br>biogeochemistry of many areas of Amazonia, and these ecosystems must be included in any<br><br>regional analysis. The DNDC model can be used to simulate carbon and nutrient<br><br>biogeochemistry in agro-ecosystems. DNDC has simulated 30 years of pasture biogeochemistry<br><br>following conversion of forest to pasture. Estimated SOM and N2O fluxes are in general<br><br>accord with a chronosequence study in Costa Rica and simulation of NO flux from fertilized<br><br>maize grown on recently cleared land is also in agreement with measurement. DNDC has<br><br>successfully simulated N2O fluxes and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in temperate and<br><br>subtropical regions. DNDC has been used to simulate N<sub>2</sub>O flux from agricultural<br><br>lands in the U.S., and is currently being used to evaluate N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from<br><br>agricultural lands in China, including wet subtropical areas. Tropical agriculture and<br><br>pasture simulations with DNDC have been focused on Costa Rica, and will be adapted to the<br><br>LBA region. </p><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Management of Data and GIS Capabilities</b><br><br><br>Our NASA EOS-IDS and Hughes Applied Information Systems are collaborative partners in a<br><br>prototyping project that will provide full GIS capability over the internet and is fully<br><br>interoperable with NASA's EOS Data and Information System Core System (ECS). One aspect of<br><br>this effort to provide a means for LBA participants to conduct geo-spatial data searches<br><br>and queries via the internet. We currently have a very rough prototype<br><br>(http://www.unh-ecs.sr.unh.edu using a Java client and server, a Spatial Data Engine<br><br>(SDE/ESRI) client and server, and an Oracle database (which provides access to several<br><br>data layers including information from the Humid Tropical Forest Inventory Project (HTFIP)<br><br>which is part of NASA's Landsat Pathfinder Project); additional data layers are available<br><br>from our EOS-IDS research effort including Hydro-Climatology layers provided by the UNH<br><br>Global Hydrology Research Group). Recently approved funding through the NASA CAN<br><br>addressing Federation of the EOSDIS will allow a significant expansion of this capability.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Remote Sensing</p><br><br><br><br><p>Issues related to validating spatial patterns of model predictions have been explored<br><br>using remote sensing. We examined model results of the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and<br><br>Analysis Project of net primary productivity (NPP), estimated in the conterminous USA at a<br><br>spatial resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 degree grids. One goal was to check the realism of the<br><br>spatial variability of model estimates using long-term monthly mean NDVI for each 0.5x0.5<br><br>grid cell, using the fact that NPP and NDVI are linearly related. Correlation for the<br><br>entire domain were relatively high (R2=0.6-0.7). However, comparison of the mean deviates<br><br>of both NDVI and simulated NPP (each grid cell value subtracted from the mean of all grid<br><br>cell values in an ecosystem type) were uncorrelated within biomes. Thus the models<br><br>appeared to be representing across-biome patterns of NPP, but no conclusion could be made<br><br>about within-biome variability. This type of analysis is potentially very powerful for<br><br>evaluating model-predicted NPP.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>A remotely sensed vegetation index can also yield insight into patterns of response of<br><br>ecosystems to climate, providing a means to evaluate model response and model-based<br><br>hypotheses. We used global AVHRR data and gridded air temperature from the Microwave<br><br>Sounding Unit to estimate the magnitude of immediate and lagged response to temperature.<br><br>Patterns of zero-, one-, and two-year lagged responses of NDVI to temperature variability<br><br>were ecosystem dependent and consistent with the hypothesis that biogeochemical mechanisms<br><br>play an important role in mediating global relationships between CO<sub>2</sub> and<br><br>temperature.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>We have successfully retrieved canopy biophysical variables, including the fraction of<br><br>PAR absorbed by the canopy (fAPAR) and albedo, using a radiative transfer model and AVHRR<br><br>data for a transect in the Central African Republic. Though observations of a single pixel<br><br>have single sun-sensor geometry, we gathered neighboring pixels in temporally composited<br><br>scenes, having similar functional ecosystem type, in order to simulate a multiple sampling<br><br>of geometry within approximately 0.5x0.5 "cells". With the advent of MISR data<br><br>from EOS AM-1, we expect both improved accuracy and the ability to perform inversions<br><br>using much smaller spatial windows. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>Berrien Moore III: modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Jerry Melillo: Biogeochemistry and terrestrial ecology</li><br><br>      <li>Steve Pacala: Modeling and terrestrial ecology</li><br><br>      <li>Charles Vorosmarty: hydrology and biogeochemical modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Bruce Peterson: hydrology and biogeochemical modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Changsheng Li: transient ecosystems and biogeochemical modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Steve Frokling: trace gases and biogeochemical modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Bobby Braswell: remote sensing and biogeochemical modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Ernest Linder: spatial statistics</li><br><br>      <li>Xiangming Xiao: remote sensing and terrestrial ecosystem modeling</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>We recognize that this research proposal is ambitious.
