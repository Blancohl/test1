<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style" style="text-align:justify">Lidar measurements of<br><br>vegetated land surfaces provide unprecedented views of the vertical and<br><br>horizontal structure of the canopy and the topography beneath.<span style="mso-spacerun:<br><br>yes">&nbsp; </span>By utilizing medium to large diameter laser footprints and<br><br>recording the entire time history of interaction between a short pulse of laser<br><br>light and the surface of the Earth, we can directly measure the vertical<br><br>structure of vegetation including canopy height, a profile of vegetation<br><br>material down through the canopy, and sub-canopy topography, as well as estimate<br><br>important biophysical parameters such as above-ground biomass. For this effort<br><br>we propose to utilize an existing research-level airborne remote sensing laser<br><br>altimeter (the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor - LVIS), enhance its associated<br><br>processing software, and collect data over areas totaling 15,000 km2 (assuming a<br><br>2 km LVIS swath and cloud-free conditions). We will produce direct measurements<br><br>of vegetation height and topography, as well as produce estimates of<br><br>above-ground biomass for the mapped regions.&nbsp; As well as providing canopy<br><br>and ground information to LBA investigators, these data act as a link between<br><br>small area ground sites and large area mapping by satellite sensors.&nbsp; Work<br><br>included in this proposal is as follows: enhance data processing system to<br><br>automatically produce validated, high-quality laser altimeter data sets, ready<br><br>the LVIS instrument for deployment to Amazonia, collect 5,000 km2 of&nbsp; LVIS<br><br>data over three LBA study areas (Santarem, Manaus and Rondonia) and an<br><br>additional 10,000 km2 along the two LBA transacts, produce validated data<br><br>products of vegetation height and topography, and collaborate with other<br><br>investigators to estimate above-ground biomass for the laser mapped region.<br><br>Further, we will compare LVIS and SRTM data products to assess the errors in the<br><br>SRTM DEM and to validate the utility of calibrating the SRTM data to potentially<br><br>produce &quot;bare earth&quot; topography and vegetation height estimates in<br><br>areas not coincidently sampled with SAR and lidar. A subset of the processed<br><br>lidar data (canopy height, topography and various parameters describing the<br><br>waveform), gridded maps of canopy height and topography, and &quot;bare<br><br>earth&quot; SRTM product will be publicly distributed as part of the LBA-DIS.<br><br>Recorded lidar waveform data for selected investigator sites only will be<br><br>available through the LBA-DIS. This is because of the large amount of data<br><br>storage required to keep this data on-line. It is expected that the full lidar<br><br>data record (that is the topography, canopy height and waveform data on a shot<br><br>by shot basis) will be distributed through the Eros Data Center (EDC) as part of<br><br>the VCL data distribution.</p></span>
