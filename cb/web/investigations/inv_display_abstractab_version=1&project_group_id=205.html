<span class="default-style">  <p>Remote sensing is a critical component of LBA<br><br>    ecology, contributing to the basin wide study primarily through land-cover<br><br>    classification, land-cover change, and biophysical retrievals. Accurate maps of<br><br>    land-cover, land cover change and canopy biophysical properties are needed as<br><br>    inputs for hydrological and biogeochemical models, as a means for quantifying<br><br>    above ground carbon stocks, scaling up flux tower measurements beyond tower<br><br>    sites and to direct field sampling.&nbsp; Currently a wide array of<br><br>    spaceborne image data are available to the project including multitemporal Landsat TM,<br><br>    AVHRR, some SAR and more recently, MODIS, SeaWiFS, Ikonos and ASTER. While many<br><br>    of these data sets are invaluable, they do not have the capability of<br><br>    separating many important land-cover classes, nor the capability of more accurate<br><br>    biophysical retrievals offered by hyperspectral systems. Examples of<br><br>    land-cover classes that cannot be distinguished reliably with image data available to the<br><br>    project include green pasture, early regeneration and tree crops. Past<br><br>    research in Eastern Amazonia, and more current research in Rondonia has shown that<br><br>    some of these ambiguities are non trivial. For example, in the vicinity of Ji<br><br>    Parana, spectral ambiguity between green pasture and second growth forest results<br><br>    in interannual fluctuations between these two cover classes of up to<br><br>    10%, with the highest proportion of second growth occuring in early dry<br><br>    season images.&nbsp; No such ambiguity will occur in hyperspectral data. Tree crops,<br><br>    which cannot be separated from some second growth forests without<br><br>    extensive supporting field data, should also be spectrally distinct in<br><br>    hyperspectral data. Improved biophysical retrievals include LAI retrievals for<br><br>    forested areas at ranges that typically saturate NDVI. &nbsp;LBA ecology is also limited by the availability<br><br>    of high quality spectral reflectance data at branch to canopy scales. In order<br><br>    to best interpret canopy reflectance, it is critical that data exist at an<br><br>    appropriate spatial scale for remotely sensed data. Because of the difficulty of<br><br>    acquiring a sufficient number of spectra from towers, an airborne campaign is<br><br>    virtually the only way to develop such a library. Not only can such a library<br><br>    improve the quality of land-cover maps, but it can be convolved to other<br><br>    sensors, and thereby used to improve analysis using broad band systems that cover a<br><br>    larger area and include archived data sets. &nbsp;For this research, we propose to address a number<br><br>    of critical problems in land-cover mapping and biophysical retrievals through<br><br>    the use of high resolution AVIRIS. We propose a 4 to 8 week deployment,<br><br>    starting in late June/early July, at the start of the dry season and<br><br>    prior to the onset of significant burning. We propose target sites in<br><br>    Rondonia that include well characterized sites such as Fazenda Nova Vida, tower<br><br>    sites such as Jaru, and a selection of targets that cover a range of land-cover<br><br>    categories (crop, pastures of ranging quality, second growth at different<br><br>    ages and primary forest). Site selection would be guided by extensive<br><br>    GIS layers and Landsat time series we have developed for the state of Rondonia.<br><br>    A key focus will be on well characterized sites. Expected products include a<br><br>    regionally specific spectral library for Rondonia that includes all major<br><br>    dominant cover types, land-cover maps using techniques developed at UCSB, and<br><br>    new biophysical maps such as LAI retrievals. UCSB will work closely with<br><br>    Brazilian collaborators and other LBA researchers to develop optimal test sites<br><br>    throughout the state. This project contributes to LBA educational initiatives<br><br>    through graduate student support of a Brazilian PhD and a remote sensing short<br><br>    course on hyperspectral remote sensing, to be taught in Rondonia and<br><br>    potentially at INPE. &nbsp; <span style="font-family:Courier">&nbsp;</span><br><br></p></span>
