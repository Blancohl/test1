<span class="default-style">  <p class="default-style">This proposal is for a continuation of our existing project, BigFoot. The overall<br><br>  goal of BigFoot and the proposed BigFoot II project is to provide validation<br><br>  of MODLand (MODIS Land Science Team) science products, including land cover,<br><br>  leaf area index (LAI), fraction absorbed photosynthetic active radiation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <br><br>  </span>(f<sub>APAR</sub>), and net primary production (NPP). To do so, we use<br><br>  ground measurements, remote sensing data, and ecosystem process models at<br><br>  sites representing different biomes. BigFoot sites are 5 x 5 km in size and<br><br>  surround the relatively small footprint (</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"WP MathA";<br><br>color:black">.</span><span style="color:black">1 km<sup>2</sup>) of CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>  flux towers. At each site we make multi-year <i>in situ</i> measurements of<br><br>  ecosystem structure and functional characteristics that are related to the<br><br>  terrestrial carbon cycle. Our sampling design allows us to explicitly examine<br><br>  scales of fine-grained spatial pattern in these properties, and provides for a<br><br>  field-based ecological characterization of the flux tower footprint.<br><br>  Multi-year measurements ensure that inter-annual validity of MODLand products<br><br>  can be assessed. <o:p><br><br>  </o:p><br><br>  </span></p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">In BigFoot II, for each measurement year we will derive land cover, f<sub>APAR</sub>,<br><br>  and LAI surfaces by linking our <i>in situ</i> measurements to Landsat ETM+<br><br>  data. These BigFoot surfaces will be developed using logic that preserves<br><br>  functionally important fine-grained information. Errors in these surfaces will<br><br>  be quantified and the surfaces summarized to provide a characterization of<br><br>  vegetation patterns in the greater flux tower footprint. Using these land<br><br>  cover and LAI surfaces and derived climate surfaces, we will model NPP over<br><br>  the 5 x 5 km BigFoot footprint. Two independent ecosystem process models will<br><br>  be used: Biome-BGC and IBIS. The ability of the models to capture<br><br>  environmental and ecological controls on water and carbon cycles will be<br><br>  assessed with the following comparisons: modeled NPP against <i>in situ</i><br><br>  measurements of NPP, modeled GPP to tower-based calculations of GPP, and<br><br>  modeled daily water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes to tower estimates. We<br><br>  will validate MODLand land cover, LAI, f<sub>APAR</sub>, and NPP surfaces by<br><br>  comparing them to BigFoot surfaces derived using field measurement data. A<br><br>  series of exercises that isolate important scaling factors will be conducted,<br><br>  so that their effects on BigFoot and MODLand NPP model estimates can be better<br><br>  understood. This will involve rerunning the models after converting<br><br>  site-specific land cover classes into broad, globally applicable classes,<br><br>  successive coarsening of land cover and LAI surface grain size, and<br><br>  generalizing the light use efficiency factor (</span><span style="font-family:"WP Greek Century";color:black">g</span><span style="color:black">)<br><br>  to coincide with the more generalized land cover classes.</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">The proposed BigFoot II study will be conducted at nine sites (several<br><br>  supported by separate funding) that span eight major biomes, from desert to<br><br>  tundra, to tropical forest. At these sites, in addition to validation of MODIS<br><br>  products, we will quantify carbon content and NPP, examine how these variables<br><br>  vary spatially and temporally, and how NPP is related to climatic variables.<br><br>  Collectively, the standardized NPP data from the contrasting biomes will<br><br>  elucidate biophysical controls on NPP, and their sensitivity to changing<br><br>  climate and land use. Our standardized data also allow for direct testing of<br><br>  whether light use efficiency (LUE) differs among plant functional types, or<br><br>  seasonally for a given type. <br><br>  </span></p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">A global terrestrial observation system is needed to assist in the<br><br>  validation of global products such as land cover and NPP from MODIS and other<br><br>  sensor and modeling programs. A key component of such a system is the eddy<br><br>  flux tower network, FLUXNET; however, flux sensors measure net ecosystem<br><br>  productivity (NEP), not NPP. BigFoot is learning how NEP and NPP are related,<br><br>  and through modeling, how to integrate a wide range of carbon cycle<br><br>  observations. Another key component of an observing system is the use of<br><br>  remote sensing and models to scale tower fluxes and field measurements.<br><br>  Although this may be relatively common at a given site, no other project is<br><br>  doing so with standardized methods across so many biomes. As such, BigFoot is<br><br>  a pathfinding activity that will contribute to the development of useful<br><br>  scaling principles. The project can also serve as a nucleus for the global<br><br>  terrestrial observing system that is needed to validate global, generalized<br><br>  products used to monitor the health of the terrestrial biosphere.</span></p></span>
