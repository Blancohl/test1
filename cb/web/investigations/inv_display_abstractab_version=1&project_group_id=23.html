<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose studies in carbon storage and exchange. We propose to work in disturbed and<br><br>undisturbed sites along a C3/C4 gradient (savanna to rainforest). </p><br><br><br><br><p>Project Overview</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose to map the entire Amazon Basin using radar images from the Japanese<br><br>JERS-1 (Japanese Earth Resources Satellite) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Because of the<br><br>radar’s ability to see through clouds, a sequence of radar images over this area<br><br>collected on each overpass of the JERS-1 satellite would result in a unique map of the<br><br>Amazon Basin in one 44 day repeat cycle.</p><br><br><br><br><p>There is a great deal of interest in the effect of the substantial flooding that occurs<br><br>along the Amazon. The JERS-1 satellite is particularly well suited to studying the extent<br><br>of flooding, due to the large amount of electromagnetic penetration to the ground through<br><br>the forest canopy at this wavelength: the radar waves penetrate to the smooth water<br><br>surface and "double bounce" off the trees trunks back to the radar, resulting in<br><br>a bright radar return for these areas.</p><br><br><br><br><p>This project will result in a unique data set, representing not only the extent of<br><br>inundation of the rainforests, but also mapping man made artifacts such as roads, cities,<br><br>cropland, and deforestation. This proposed map will be used by the international team of<br><br>investigators to examine the amount of deforestation present over the entire Amazon Basin.<br><br>Since radar observations are not hampered by clouds or rain, we will for the first time<br><br>get a "snapshot" of the current state of deforestation. Comparison of this data<br><br>set with past and future maps will enable the rate of deforestation to be estimated. In<br><br>addition, different biological habitats will be distinguishable in the radar images. This<br><br>data will be made available to scientists studying the Amazon initially through the<br><br>release of a CD-ROM set containing the data, and later on the Internet.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Radar images from JERS-1 have been used successfully to determine flood extent, basic<br><br>vegetation type (including clear-cuts), and to study changes in these parameters. We<br><br>propose to extend our development of algorithms which can be applied to JERS-1 data over<br><br>the entire Amazon to generate maps of flooding and vegetation type. These maps will be<br><br>verified against stream gauge date, vegetation maps, field studies, and complementary<br><br>remotely sensed data from selected sites. These correspond to NASA categories in Land<br><br>Surface Hydrologic Interfaces, Ecological Processes and Modeling, and Environmental<br><br>Consequences of Landcover Change and USGCP efforts in Biogeochemical Dynamics, and<br><br>Ecological Systems and Dynamics.</p><br><br><br><br><p>This project is a collaborative effort with scientists from the Jet Propulsion<br><br>Laboratory (JPL, U.S.), the University of California –(UCSB, U.S.), the Alaska SAR<br><br>Facility (ASF, U.S.), The National Institute for Space Research (INPE, Brazil), the<br><br>National Institute for Amazon Research (INPA, Brazil), the National Space Development<br><br>Agency of Japan (NASDA, Japan), and the British National Space Center (BNSC, UK).</p></span>
