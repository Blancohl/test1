<span class="default-style">  <p class="default-style">Cycles of carbon and nitrogen in forest ecosystems<br><br>  are tightly linked through a shared set of biological processes.&nbsp; At the<br><br>  leaf level, rates of net photosynthesis have been related to nitrogen<br><br>  concentrations among species from diverse biomes around the world.&nbsp; At<br><br>  the canopy level, nitrogen concentrations have been related to rates of forest<br><br>  production, soil C:N ratios and rates of N cycling.&nbsp; In aggregate, this<br><br>  suggests that remote sensing of foliar nitrogen chemistry can offer a useful<br><br>  approach to scaling point-based carbon flux measurements to local landscapes<br><br>  or regions.&nbsp; In one recent study, data from NASA’s AVIRIS sensor was<br><br>  successfully used to map aboveground NPP and soil carbon to nitrogen ratios<br><br>  across a large and heterogeneous forest landscape.&nbsp;</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">Here, we propose to extend this approach across wider<br><br>  range of forest ecosystems that span a boreal to tropical gradient, where<br><br>  carbon flux measurements are available from eddy covariance towers and<br><br>  extensive plot-based measurements.&nbsp; The sites to be analyzed are part of<br><br>  the AmeriFlux or FLUXNET CO2 exchange research programs and all are located in<br><br>  Brazil and the USA.&nbsp; The Brazilian sites include: LBA sites km 67 and km<br><br>  83 in the Tapajos National Forest near Santarem, and LBA sites km 14 and km 34<br><br>  in the Amazonas region.&nbsp; The US sites include Howland, ME; Harvard<br><br>  Forest, MA; Duke Forest, NC and Gainsville, FL.&nbsp;</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">In building our field and remote sensing campaign<br><br>  around AmeriFlux and FLUXNET research sites, the proposed work will bring the<br><br>  added benefit of allowing eddy covariance CO2 exchange measurements to be<br><br>  interpreted for the first time with respect to patterns of remotely-sensed<br><br>  canopy chemistry within the surrounding landscapes.&nbsp; We will examine<br><br>  several approaches to undertaking this, including qualitative analyses of CO2<br><br>  exchange with respect to varying wind direction and associated canopy nitrogen<br><br>  levels as well as spatially-explicit application of a forest ecosystem model.</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">Research Plan:</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">For the 2003 field season, we plan to visit the 4<br><br>  tower sites that are part of our investigation during June of 2003 with the<br><br>  following objectives:&nbsp; At each site we will coordinate with other<br><br>  cooperating investigators to supplement existing field data with new leaf<br><br>  nutrient measurements to build complete data sets for foliar chemistry,<br><br>  biomass production and soil C:N ratios in order to examine relations among<br><br>  these variables both within and across sites.&nbsp;</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">Hyperspectral remote sensing data will be acquired<br><br>  from NASA’s AVIRIS (4 m pixel resolution) and Hyperion (30 m resolution)<br><br>  instruments for development of data planes for foliar chemistry and associated<br><br>  carbon fluxes using relationships observed within the field data.&nbsp; This<br><br>  will provide insight into the nature and generality of forest carbon-nitrogen<br><br>  relations across ecosystems and climate regimes and could open new<br><br>  possibilities for mapping fine-scale patterns of growth in other regions<br><br>  around the world.</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">After completion of the field campaign, field and<br><br>  remote sensing data will be used to modify and run a forest ecosystem model<br><br>  with the aim of modeling canopy carbon fluxes for comparison with tower<br><br>  measurements.&nbsp; Refinement of canopy physiology algorithms (for Amax, SLA<br><br>  and light attenuation) for model application to Amazonian forests will be<br><br>  achieved through involvement of a Brazilian graduate student.&nbsp; Use of a<br><br>  common modeling platform across all sites will provide a means of examining<br><br>  variation across sites (i.e. with respect to differences in climate and canopy<br><br>  physiology) as well as spatial variation within sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>
