<span class="default-style"><p>This proposal is in response to the NASA-Carbon Cycle<br><br>      Science and LBA-Ecology Program request for remote sensing research and<br><br>      the development of methods and datasets for exploring the response of<br><br>      ecosystems to disturbance at the regional scale.  We propose a four-step, incremental approach directed toward<br><br>      the spatially explicit modeling and mapping of forest regrowth potential<br><br>      for the Amazon region. Each of the four steps will make a significant<br><br>      contribution to current understanding of the response of ecosystems to<br><br>      disturbance at the regional scale.  Developing<br><br>      an ability to predict forest regrowth potential has considerable<br><br>      implications for our understanding of carbon dynamics in a future<br><br>      characterized by increased conversion of old-growth Amazonian forests and<br><br>      the subsequent abandonment of many areas originally cleared for<br><br>      agricultural activities. A central focus of our approach is the<br><br>      development of remote sensing approaches for quantifying vegetation<br><br>      recovery and changes in biomass following disturbance, determination of<br><br>      the optimal scale for these approaches, and testing of<br><br>      disturbance-specific parameters that may influence rates of forest<br><br>      regrowth in Amazonia.<o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>      <o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>  </p><br><br>      <p>Step 1 is the<br><br>      production of preliminary forest regrowth potential maps for the region<br><br>      using an empirical model of biomass accumulation in global secondary<br><br>      forests (Johnson et al.2000; see Appendix B).  The maps are a spatially explicit application of model algorithms<br><br>      within a GIS framework constrained by readily available regional datasets<br><br>      on climate and soil texture.  Step<br><br>      1 products include maps illustrating potential biomass accumulation in<br><br>      Amazonian regrowth forests at 5-year intervals (Zarin et al. submitted;<br><br>      see Appendix C).<o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>      <o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>  </p><br><br>      <p>Step 2 is the<br><br>      definition of a set of normalized spectral indices of forest regrowth<br><br>      optimized for the Amazon region.  These<br><br>      indices will be derived from MASTER and multi-temporal Landsat TM/<br><br>      ETM+data and calibrated against field measurements of regrowth structure<br><br>      and estimates of canopy height and vertical distribution. The ideal<br><br>      resolution for these spectral indices will be quantified. Expected<br><br>      products from Step 2 include forest regrowth data bundles that will<br><br>      contain age and land use history for each stand, temporal sequences of<br><br>      regrowth indices, derived canopy height, canopy profiles and canopy<br><br>      structural properties for a subset of regrowth stands.<o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>      <o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>  </p><br><br>      <p>Step 3 is the<br><br>      testing of the reliability of the preliminary maps (Step 1 product) and<br><br>      the remote sensing indices of regrowth structure (Step 2 products). We<br><br>      will employ traditional validation methods to compare the spatially<br><br>      explicit model predictions with forest inventory data not included in the<br><br>      development of the model.  Validation<br><br>      is used here in a strictly statistical sense.  Using independent data, we will assess the bias and variance<br><br>      characteristics of the global model when used as a regional predictor,<br><br>      including partitioning the variance components into local (within-site)<br><br>      and regional (between-site) components.  And although the model was developed with reference to regrowth<br><br>      biomass, we will also test its applicability to the prediction of regrowth<br><br>      structure as expressed by the spectral indices defined in Step 2.  AIRSAR estimates of biomass will be tested and compared to assess<br><br>      between-site and seasonal differences in SAR based biomass retrievals.<br><br>      Expected products from Step 3 are spatially explicit accuracy assessment<br><br>      of regrowth maps for biomass and structure, based on both field and<br><br>      remotely-sensed data.  <o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>      <o:p><br><br>      </o:p><br><br>  </p><br><br>      <p>Step 4 is the<br><br>      refinement of the global model to enhance its regional applicability by<br><br>      including known disturbance-specific parameters shown to explain a<br><br>      significant amount of variance between measured and modeled regrowth<br><br>      biomass and structure.  We<br><br>      will test parameters that describe disturbance type, size, perimeter:area<br><br>      ratio and land-use history, including the number of agricultural cycles<br><br>      and persistence of the various stages of vegetation cover.  Remote sensing based observations are required to adequately test<br><br>      the importance of these disturbance-specific parameters with a sufficient<br><br>      number of observations. A subset of the forest inventory data will be used<br><br>      to calibrate this regional enhancement of the model.  Model selection will employ cross-validation with reserved<br><br>      independent data, or resampling cross-validation techniques, to avoid<br><br>      overfitting and to assess expected prediction errors.  The resulting spatial pattern of predictions will also be compared<br><br>      to the spatial pattern of the spectral indices defined in Step 2. The<br><br>      principal products of Step 4 will be a regionally refined and<br><br>      accuracy-assessed forest regrowth potential model and derivative maps that<br><br>      will provide our best predictions (and corresponding error estimates) for<br><br>      the regional responses of biomass and forest structure to current and<br><br>      future land-use patterns in Amazonia.</p></span>
