<span class="default-style">  <p class="default-style">This proposal is motivated<br><br>  by the question “How do ecosystems respond to and affect global<br><br>  environmental change and the carbon cycle?” for the Amazônian forest<br><br>  ecosystem. Over the last decade, description of carbon exchange processes has<br><br>  been introduced into some of the more realistic and important<br><br>  Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models used in General Circulation<br><br>  Models (GCMs). Over the last decade, important progress has also been made in<br><br>  developing state-of-the-art multi-parameter estimation techniques that can<br><br>  provide values of preferred sets of the (often many) model parameters used in<br><br>  complex SVAT models by optimizing against the (often multiple) measurements<br><br>  collected in present-day field experiments. The LBA Experiment is providing a<br><br>  uniquely rich source of long-term field data for Amazon forest sites in<br><br>  different climatic conditions and for a range of soils and disturbance<br><br>  regimes. We propose to use these data to calibrate the description of the<br><br>  carbon and energy-water exchange processes represented in two advanced SVAT<br><br>  models (SiB2C and MOSES-TRIFFID) using advanced multi-parameter estimation<br><br>  techniques. Further, we will investigate whether and how the preferred sets of<br><br>  model parameters in the two SVAT models change with season, the nature of the<br><br>  underlying soil, and/or disturbance regimes, and explore relationships between<br><br>  the preferred parameters found at individual LBA sites and relevant remotely<br><br>  sensed (e.g., TERRA) data products. The National Centers for Environmental<br><br>  prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting<br><br>  (ECMWF) are both currently preparing long (50-year and 40-year, respectively)<br><br>  time series of atmospheric variables (including near-surface atmospheric<br><br>  forcing variables) from historical atmospheric and remotely sensed<br><br>  observations using data assimilation techniques. These time series will become<br><br>  available for scientific use within the lifetime of this proposal. We propose<br><br>  to compare these new model-calculated re-analysis data with Amazônian climate<br><br>  records and with field data obtained during LBA and earlier studies to<br><br>  investigate their reliability within Amazônia. Assuming these data are<br><br>  reasonably realistic (or that simple corrections can be made to make them so),<br><br>  we then propose to use these historical data to force two-dimensional arrays<br><br>  of calibrated versions of SiB2C and MOSES-TRIFFID to investigate<br><br>  model-to-model differences and the spatial and temporal variability in carbon<br><br>  exchange of and within the Amazônian region. When doing so, we will exploit<br><br>  any relationships we have previously found between calibrated parameters and<br><br>  seasonal climate, forest disturbance, underlying soil type, and remotely<br><br>  sensed variables, as appropriate.   </p></span>
