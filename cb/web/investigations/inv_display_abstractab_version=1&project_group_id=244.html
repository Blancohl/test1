<p class="default-style"><strong>Regional Effects of Selective Logging on Canopy Damage and Nutrient Dynamics in Amazonia: Linking Landsat ETM+ and Field Biogeochemical Studies</strong></p>

<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style">Selective logging is a<br><br>  dominant form of land use in the Brazilian Amazon.  Several LBA studies<br><br>  are quantifying the effects of logging on carbon dynamics, including the role<br><br>  of fire as an agent of continued change following timber harvest. <br><br>  Despite ongoing efforts, surprisingly little is known about the extent,<br><br>  intensity or biogeochemical effects of logging in Amazon forests.  At the<br><br>  scale of the entire Basin, the extent of logging is hotly contested, with<br><br>  current estimates ranging from 2,000-15,000 km2 yr-1.  Even less is known<br><br>  about the intensity of logging, where intensity is defined here as canopy<br><br>  structural damage caused by the harvest operation.  Moreover, there<br><br>  exists almost no information on changes in nutrient stocks and dynamics in<br><br>  selectively logged forests.  The fate of nutrients could be central to<br><br>  determining rates of regrowth and the long-term sustainability of timber<br><br>  harvesting in Amazonia.</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">During the past two years,<br><br>  we have tested a method to quantify both the extent and intensity of selective<br><br>  logging using Landsat ETM+ data with a Monte Carlo spectral mixture model. <br><br>  The method produces coverages of fractional canopy, bare soil and surface<br><br>  necromass (slash) cover, along with statistical uncertainty maps for each<br><br>  cover fraction.  The canopy fractional cover results have proven highly<br><br>  correlated with field-measured forest gap fraction, which in turn, is<br><br>  spatially correlated with the volume (and biomass) of wood removed from the<br><br>  forest and the coarse woody debris remaining in the harvest sites.  This<br><br>  approach opens the door to regional-scale studies of logging extent and<br><br>  intensity as well as the resulting changes in carbon and nutrient stocks. <br><br>  Before considering the method viable for basin-wide logging studies,<br><br>  additional testing is needed across a wider range of forest structural types,<br><br>  logging regimes and in areas subjected to fire following harvest. <br><br>  Additional studies are also needed to determine the functional, quantitative<br><br>  linkages between satellite-observed changes in forest canopy cover and exposed<br><br>  surface slash, carbon stock changes in vegetation and soils, and nutrient<br><br>  cycling.</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">We propose to extend our<br><br>  remote sensing approach to a much larger region of the Amazon, and to further<br><br>  develop linkages between our satellite analyses and measured carbon and<br><br>  nutrient changes.  The satellite studies will take place primarily in<br><br>  Para and Mato Grosso states, and will cover the period 1999-2004.  We<br><br>  will use the fractional cover maps to direct field studies and continued<br><br>  canopy gap fraction validation efforts across a range of forest types. <br><br>  The field sites will include low- and high-damage logging blocks with and<br><br>  without fire, and additional areas containing forest structural variation<br><br>  under study by groups led by Dan Nepstad, Foster Brown, Emilio Moran, and<br><br>  other LBA collaborators.  At a subset of sites within the imagery, we<br><br>  will quantify changes in vegetation and soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and base<br><br>  cation stocks.  Using established logging chronosequences, we will<br><br>  measure changes in nutrient pools, mineralization rates and other key nutrient<br><br>  cycling processes to determine the short-term and the potential long-term<br><br>  effects of harvest on nutrient availability.  We will use the canopy<br><br>  damage information derived from Landsat ETM+ to spatially integrate nutrient<br><br>  and carbon data, and to predict regional-scale changes in nutrient stocks and<br><br>  their partitioning in vegetation and soils.  Our results will be compared<br><br>  to studies of intact forest underway by other LBA teams.  We will also<br><br>  use the Landsat analyses of logging extent and intensity to assess linkages<br><br>  between logging practices and the spatial and temporal patterns of fire<br><br>  occurrence over large regions of the eastern Amazon.  Fire occurrence<br><br>  data have been and will be provided by the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM)<br><br>  satellite, and will be validated during our (and Nepstad’s) proposed field<br><br>  studies.</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">The project will produce a<br><br>  set of tangible products to be freely shared by LBA investigators and<br><br>  Brazilian agencies such as EMBRAPA and INPE.  These include: (1) regional<br><br>  maps of selective logging extent and canopy damage for 1999-2004; (2) nutrient<br><br>  stock and flux data partitioned by forest and soil types, and by landscape<br><br>  units such as logging decks, roads, skid trails, and tree-falls; (3) spatially<br><br>  integrated nutrient budgets showing how nutrients are altered by logging; and<br><br>  (4) regional maps of canopy damage from logging in relation to fire occurrence<br><br>  from field and TRMM satellite data. This project will have a strong<br><br>  educational component, including: (a) training a Brazilian and an American<br><br>  post-doc, including exchange between the co-PIs labs; (b) training students<br><br>  from the Universidade de Brasilia in remote sensing studies and field methods;<br><br>  (c) training of EMBRAPA personnel in the use and validation of the satellite<br><br>  results; and (d) outreach to Brazilian land managers interested in the use of<br><br>  satellite data for logging operations (technology transfer).</p><br><br>  <p class="default-style">The project will directly<br><br>  address LBA questions LC-Q3, CD-Q3b, CD-Q3c, and ND-Q1.   In doing<br><br>  so, we will contribute to answering the overall LBA question: “How do<br><br>  tropical forest conversion, re-growth and selective logging influence carbon<br><br>  storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable<br><br>  land use in Amazonia?”</p></span>
