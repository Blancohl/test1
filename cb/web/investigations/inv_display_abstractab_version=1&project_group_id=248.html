<span class="default-style"><p class="MsoNormal">Research Approach<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="MsoNormal">Our major focus will be on the questions “What are the<br><br>impacts of conventional and reduced impact logging on above and belowground<br><br>carbon and nutrient stocks and water and nutrient fluxes and how do these<br><br>impacts change over time following the logging?” Answering these carbon and<br><br>nutrient dynamics science questions will require ground-based biogeochemical<br><br>studies and the enhancement and use of currently available GIS techniques.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The specific goals of our<br><br>project are to: (1) Measure existing forest biomass (carbon) and nutrient stocks<br><br>and validate available models for estimating forest biomass. (2) Quantify the<br><br>impact of soil texture and fertility gradients on above and belowground C and<br><br>nutrient stocks in local forests, and (3) Measure the impact of conventional<br><br>(CL) versus reduced impact logging (RIL) on C dynamics. If time and funds<br><br>permit, we will also obtain measurements on the quantity and composition of<br><br>sediment, nutrients, water and organic matter entering first order streams.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="MsoNormal">We will estimate aboveground live biomass in primary forest<br><br>using four alternative allometric equations that were calculated for moist<br><br>tropical forest trees and fine-tune these estimates with destructive sampling<br><br>and direct measurements of trees in similar forests and soils at settlement<br><br>sites adjacent to primary forest on our site. Because settlers completely clear<br><br>the forest for agriculture on 20-30% of their land, we will be able to use<br><br>destructive harvests for all DBH size classes and then estimate the biomass<br><br>contribution of bole extensions belowground. We will also use the plots on<br><br>settlements to directly measure vine and epiphyte biomass and relate this to<br><br>aboveground tree biomass.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We propose to quantify the<br><br>impact of soil texture and fertility gradients on above and belowground C and<br><br>nutrient stocks in local forests. We will use an empirical and a modeling<br><br>approach to examine the relationship of soil texture, especially clay content,<br><br>to patterns in above and belowground C and nutrient pools. Our site is<br><br>characterized by an Oxisol-Ultisol-Entisol association that is commonly found<br><br>across the Amazon basin. To examine the role of texture in greater detail, and<br><br>to test mechanisms by which texture influences the biogeochemistry of moist<br><br>lowland tropical forests, we will use the Century model to simulate the forest<br><br>on the different soil textural classes at our site. Our data will contribute<br><br>significantly to the robustness and reliability of existing allometric equations<br><br>for forest biomass across the Amazon.<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify">In<br><br>addition, our site has a 10 year chronosequence of selective, conventional (CL)<br><br>and reduced impact logging (RIL). We propose to evaluate the We will use the<br><br>data from the studies mentioned above to measure the impact of CL and RIL on<br><br>above and belowground C and nutrient dynamics. The removal of trees inevitably<br><br>leads to nutrient export from the forest ecosystem. It is unclear to what extent<br><br>nutrients are distributed among topsoil, subsoil, litter layer, standing biomass<br><br>and streams by selective logging. We will collaborate with Richey et al. (CD-06)<br><br>to link our measurements of C and nutrient flows to first order streams with<br><br>local rivers. We are collaborating with Asner et al (LC-13) to evaluate canopy<br><br>damage and the hyperspectral signatures of various stages in the selective<br><br>logging chronosequence – from primary forest to the logging event to regrowth.<br><br>Our links with work in CD-06 and LC 13 will contribute to the assessments of the<br><br>impacts of selective logging on carbon management at the basin scale.</p></span>
