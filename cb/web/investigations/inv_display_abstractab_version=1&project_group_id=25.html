<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style">We propose an integrated remote sensing and<br><br>field-based examination of the causes and biogeochemical consequences of<br><br>regional land-cover change within the Arc of Deforestation in the southern<br><br>Amazon Basin. Research components include field observations, regional<br><br>synthesis, and multiresolution studies, with a major focus on remote sensing. <br><br>We will refine the standardized methods we developed during LBA-ECO Phase I for<br><br>consistent mapping of regional land-cover conversion through time. The<br><br>techniques will be expanded to include diverse environmental variation, and new<br><br>methods will be developed to map forest degraded by logging, fire, and<br><br>fragmentation.  These remote sensing products will be combined with<br><br>ancillary data sets and field measurements to evaluate the relative importance<br><br>of environmental and human controls on patterns of land-cover change, and the<br><br>consequences of land-cover change for vegetation growth and succession and for<br><br>soil and stream biogeochemistry.  Our previous research in Rondônia shows<br><br>that variations in topography and rock type generate significant gradients in<br><br>natural soil fertility and stream nutrient concentrations across the state. <br><br>Roads and urban networks, superimposed on this natural variation, constrain or<br><br>accelerate land-cover conversion and have important consequences for human<br><br>impacts on stream biogeochemistry.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">Our questions represent diverse<br><br>academic disciplines, but all aim to combine remote sensing with field<br><br>measurements to develop an integrated understanding of regional patterns in<br><br>land-cover change and its biogeochemical consequences.  In addition to<br><br>producing a variety of remote sensing products to monitor land-cover change, we<br><br>will address the following questions:  How can remote sensing methods be<br><br>combined with field measurements to better quantify changes in vegetation<br><br>community structure due to selective logging, and how extensive are those<br><br>changes?  What are the topographic and geologic determinants of soil<br><br>mineralogy and fertility across the state of Rondônia, and how does this<br><br>natural variation in soil type constrain or promote land-cover conversion? <br><br>Finally, how do vegetation conversion and the evolving human settlement system<br><br>affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemistry and over what scales do these<br><br>drivers operate?<o:p><br><br></o:p><br><br></p><br><br><p class="default-style">Our research approach can be<br><br>divided into three intersecting phases: 1) mapping and monitoring a suite of<br><br>land-cover changes; 2) evaluation of the natural and human drivers of forest<br><br>conversion; and 3) measurement of the impacts of those changes on forest<br><br>structure in selectively logged areas and on soil and stream biogeochemistry in<br><br>areas converted to pasture.  The research will be conducted in the<br><br>Brazilian states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso, which show significant intra- and<br><br>interstate variations in deforestation rates, selective logging intensity, urban<br><br>development, and environmental gradients.  An important aspect of the<br><br>project is a dedication to exchange research methods and techniques in the LBA/Amazon<br><br>research community, most intensively among Imazon, INPE, and UCSB. <br><br>Institutional exchanges will provide an opportunity for intensive training, data<br><br>sharing and research collaboration among U.S. and Brazilian participants.<o:p><br><br></o:p></span>
