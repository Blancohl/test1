<span class="default-style">Airborne FTIR, PTR-MS, and PM instrumentation will be deployed on the INPE Bandeirante during August-September of 2004 for the first comprehensive measurements of the initial emissions from Brazilian fires. These fires should include well-characterized savanna fires (near Brasilia) carried out by the research group of H. Miranda and well-characterized deforestation fires (near Alta Floresta) carried out by the research group of J. Carvalho. The latter fires will feature time-resolved fuel consumption measurements coupled with ground-based and airborne emissions measurements to determine the contribution of residual smoldering combustion to overall emissions. The airborne component will also focus on time-resolved measurements of post-emission changes in the smoke chemistry due to photochemistry and cloud processing. In-plume OH may be measured. CO profiles will be measured during satellite overpasses and the potential value of acetonitrile as a tracer for Brazilian biomass burning will be investigated. If possible, we will measure trace gas and particle emissions from cooking fires and sugar cane fires.</span>
