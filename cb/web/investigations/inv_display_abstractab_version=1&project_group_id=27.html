<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style" s>Deforestation in the<br><br>Amazon has the potential to alter the biogeochemistry of carbon and major<br><br>nutrients over large regions and to alter the movements of these materials among<br><br>adjoining ecosystems. Small streams dominate the total length of stream channels<br><br>in the landscape. They receive material from adjacent uplands and contribute<br><br>material to larger rivers. Because of their position, small streams and their<br><br>associated riparian zones thus play a key role in the landscape as links and<br><br>regulators of material fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and larger rivers<br><br>of the Amazon Basin.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">Our goal is to develop an<br><br>understanding of how C and nutrients are transformed as water moves from uplands<br><br>through small streams to larger rivers in forested and deforested landscapes of<br><br>the Amazon. We will do this by: 1) focusing on carbon and nutrient<br><br>transformations in riparian zones and small stream channels--key points in the<br><br>landscape where these transformations are potentially of major importance but<br><br>very poorly known in tropical landscapes; 2) comparing these transformations in<br><br>drainage basins with forest and pasture land use and in streams of different<br><br>sizes, and; 3) coupling our process level work with information on land use and<br><br>riparian zone structure derived from remote sensing and models of stream channel<br><br>processing to predict transfers of organic matter and nutrients to larger rivers<br><br>in stream networks. The work will be focused in central Rondônia.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">In riparian<br><br>zones, we will determine the spatial variability of water entering and leaving<br><br>the riparian zones of forest and pasture streams of different sizes using<br><br>surveys of ground water characteristics. We will use 15N, nutrient<br><br>and conservative tracer additions to identify key processes and rates of<br><br>transformation in the groundwater of forest and pasture riparian zones.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">In stream<br><br>channels, we will use 15N tracer additions in forest and pasture<br><br>streams to determine key processes and rates of transformation, and production<br><br>and consumption of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon. We<br><br>will use the isotopes of 13C in dissolved organic carbon and<br><br>dissolved inorganic carbon and different particulate and dissolved constituents<br><br>to trace the sources of C to streams. We will extend this work to a regional<br><br>basis with surveys of nutrients and organic matter in 2-5th order<br><br>streams in forest and pasture land use on different soil types within the<br><br>region.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">At the regional<br><br>scale, satellite images will be used to classify areas to land use type,<br><br>riparian zone type and extent and length of stream channels of different stream<br><br>orders in forest and pasture. A multi-compartment stream biogeochemistry model<br><br>will be used to predict the transformations of C and N and their downstream<br><br>transport in streams of different sizes and land uses. We will integrate<br><br>watershed land use area and stream channel length in different land use types to<br><br>estimate regional impacts of land use change on biogeochemical cycles in small<br><br>streams and transport from small streams to larger rivers.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">This project will bring<br><br>together studies of land and water biogeochemistry and link them together with<br><br>an understanding of changes in processes that occur in key points in the<br><br>landscape. It will provide new information on how these processes change when<br><br>forest is replaced by pasture and it will put this information in a framework to<br><br>predict the effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on stream water quality and<br><br>C and nutrient transport to larger rivers.</p></span>
