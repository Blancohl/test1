<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose studies in three theme areas of LBA: carbon storage; nutrient dynamics; and<br><br>trace gas fluxes. Training of Brazilian collaborators and graduate students is an<br><br>important goal. We propose to evaluate soil biogeochemical processes on degraded pastures<br><br>and in six-year-old agro-silvopastoral systems at the EMBRAPA-CPAA experiment site located<br><br>54 km from Manaus on BR 174 and adjacent to the primary forest site used by INPA. The<br><br>degraded pastures are on the widely distributed clayey Oxisol (clayey, kaolinitic,<br><br>isohyperthermic, Xanthic Hapludox). </p><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Carbon Stocks.</b> Our preliminary data from recent work in the Amazon show dramatic<br><br>increases in biomass accumulation in both native and exotic tree and grass species with<br><br>modest additions of P and Ca to soils. To assess these priming effects of nutrients, we<br><br>will measure total system carbon (woody biomass, understory herbaceous biomass, litter<br><br>fall, surface litter, roots, fine root dynamics and soil) in fertilized and non fertilized<br><br>pasture chronosequence (2 years to 25 years). Similar measurements will be done in four,<br><br>well-characterized six-year-old agro-silvopastoral (ASP) systems that were established on<br><br>degraded pastures. Analyses of C stocks and pools will provide us with data for predictive<br><br>models of vegetation regrowth and carbon dynamics as a function of management<br><br>interventions.</p><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Nutrient Dynamics.</b> We will measure nutrient stocks and cycling and water dynamics<br><br>in both the fertilized and non-fertilized pasture chronosequence and ASP systems. Although<br><br>the focus of the study will be on P and Ca as major limiting nutrients, the need for<br><br>nutrient additions will be based on analysis of soil nutrient levels and nutrient<br><br>availability, coupled with yield projections and nutrient budgets for the systems. We will<br><br>also measure (a) soil moisture and surface temperature and the resulting soil fauna<br><br>(decomposer) populations, (b) chemical characteristics (lignin, cellulose, polyphenols,<br><br>and other nutrients) of the litter, and (c) litter decomposition and nutrient release<br><br>patterns in the fertilized and non fertilized pasture and ASP systems. We expect to obtain<br><br>a better understanding of the response of the various components of the decomposers to<br><br>changes in microclimate, litter quality, and soil nutrient status and thus improve our<br><br>ability to predict rates of decomposition and hence nutrient release patterns in different<br><br>pasture and ASP use scenarios. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Our measurements of above and below-ground productivity linked to the physical,<br><br>chemical and biological factors will provide information on processes controlling carbon<br><br>and nutrient dynamics in abandoned pastures and the management alternatives to<br><br>rehabilitate abandoned pasture land. The detailed characterization of the soils,<br><br>vegetation, management and environmental variables at our site will facilitate<br><br>extrapolation of the results to other sites. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>John Duxbury: Soil carbon and biogeochemistry</li><br><br>      <li>Erick Fernandes: Nutrient cycling, above and below-ground productivity</li><br><br>      <li>Regerio Perin: Managed pastures.</li><br><br>      <li>Neliton Silva: Soil fauna and Insect ecology</li><br><br>      <li>Wilhelmus Sombroek: Soil taxonomy and soil nutrient dynamics.</li><br><br>      <li>Susan Riha: Soil water and nutrient dynamics and modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Elisa Wandelli: Forest ecology and secondary species succession.</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>Preferred Site</p><br><br><br><br><p>We hope to work in degraded and abandoned pastures in the Manaus region and on<br><br>agroforestry systems at the EMBRAPA-CPAA experiment station located on the road from<br><br>Manaus to Boa Vista (BR 174). </p><br><br><br><br><p>Activities</p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <p><b>1</b>.
