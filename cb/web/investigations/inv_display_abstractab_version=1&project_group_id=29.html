<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>The principal objectives of this proposal are to: </p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Review and synthesize previous research that has examined nitrogen (N) and phosphorus<br><br>    (P) pools and cycling patterns in Amazonian forests and cerrado,</li><br><br>  <li>Review and synthesize previous research addressing changes in N and P dynamics caused by<br><br>    conversion of forest and cerrado to other land-uses (e.g., pasture, secondary forest after<br><br>    logging, agroforestry systems, and tree plantations), and</li><br><br>  <li>Outline gaps in present knowledge and suggest future research directions in this area.<br><br>    Over the past thirty years, road building and government-backed colonization schemes in<br><br>    the Amazon Basin have resulted in increases in human population and rising pressures on<br><br>    natural resources.</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>Concurrent with this modern colonization of the Amazon has been a growing body of<br><br>knowledge about nutrient dynamics in Amazonian forests and the affects of forest<br><br>conversion on nutrient storage and cycling. As this body of literature has expanded, it is<br><br>clear that the compilation and synthesis of results from these studies is essential to<br><br>provide researchers and research managers with a concise reference to previous work (much<br><br>of which is available only in Portuguese), identify gaps in knowledge and potential future<br><br>research directions, as well as provide policy makers, landowners and land managers with<br><br>information pertinent to the ecological effects of land use changes in the region.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Continuing conversion of forests to other land uses in the Amazon Basin is inevitable,<br><br>especially in areas that are close to major rivers, highways, or cities. Therefore, it is<br><br>essential to address the long-term impacts of forest conversion on nutrient pools and<br><br>cycling rates and patterns to better understand the limits to productivity once forest<br><br>cover has been removed. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two elements of particular<br><br>importance, particularly since their availability for plant uptake are thought to limit<br><br>primary production (or carbon [C] fixation rates) of ecosystems based on the highly<br><br>weathered Oxisol and Ultisol soils which cover the majority of the Amazon Basin. <br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose to produce at least one co-authored review paper suitable for publication in<br><br>the journal Ecological Applications; it is not yet clear whether more than one publication<br><br>will be warranted, although the three project objectives are suitable to this if the<br><br>volume of the synthesis in the three sub-areas is sufficient. The publication(s) will also<br><br>be produced in Portuguese for dissemination and use in Brazilian institutions. In<br><br>addition, we will publish the results, in part or in whole, in NASA/LBA proceedings as<br><br>appropriate and contribute the results to the NASA/LBA database (LBA-ECO DIS). </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team</p><br><br><br><br><p>This literature review and analysis will be conducted through an international<br><br>collaboration with researchers from institutions in the U.S., Brazil, and Canada. The<br><br>three investigators of this project collectively have literature available from a wide<br><br>range of sources and countries and in several languages. The investigators worked together<br><br>from 1993-1996 at the Curuá-Una Research Station (100 km east of Santarém, Pará) in a<br><br>project that examined plant-induced changes of soil nutrient dynamics under native forest<br><br>and tree plantations under a USDA competitive grant. The proposed project is designed to<br><br>be completed within one year. </p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Henry Lewis Gholz, Professor of Forest Ecology and Graduate Coordinator, School of<br><br>    Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA<br><br>    352-846-0889 hlg@nervm.nerdc.ufl.edu</li><br><br>  <li>Francisco de Assis Oliveira, Professor of Forest Ecology, Department of Forestry,<br><br>    Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias do Para (FCAP) C.P. 917 Belém, Pará, Brazil 66093-000,<br><br>    fax 55 91 226 3814, phone 55 91 226 3493</li><br><br>  <li>C.
