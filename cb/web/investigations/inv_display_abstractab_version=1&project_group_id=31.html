<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose to study the carbon dynamics of intensively managed tree plantations and<br><br>directly compare them to those of adjacent undisturbed primary forest. There are at least<br><br>four current plantation operations in the Amazon basin and these intensively managed<br><br>systems are sometimes regarded as a strategy to increase fiber production per unit of land<br><br>area and relieve pressures for harvesting native forests. There are questions, however, as<br><br>to how conversion to plantations from primary forest or abandoned agriculture land will<br><br>modify or restore normal ecological processes, particularly, what is the long term<br><br>sustainability of these plantation systems? We propose to address this issue by comparing<br><br>the carbon cycling processes of intensively managed plantations to adjacent undisturbed<br><br>primary forest. In collaboration with the Agriculture College of the State of Pará, we<br><br>will make a comparison of soil carbon inputs, soil carbon fractions, and the chemical<br><br>differences between the soils of these two forest types. We assume that land use<br><br>conversion will result in significant and measurable changes in the carbon inventory of<br><br>the site and that a stable level of biologically active soil organic matter is the<br><br>determining factor in long-term site productivity. We seek to identify those components of<br><br>the carbon cycle most affected by intensive plantation management.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>In relation to the stated objectives of the LBA program, our research (1) addresses a<br><br>specific data gap, (2) measures changes in carbon cycling caused by a land use conversion<br><br>in the Amazon, and (3) specifically attempts to address the sustainability of this<br><br>conversion. This data will be essential to determine the suitability of intensively<br><br>managed plantations as a viable and acceptable land use option in the Amazon. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Approaches</p><br><br><br><br><p>Two sites will be investigated -- a clay soil and a sandy soil. Eight sample blocks of<br><br>10 m radius will be established at each site, 4 in the plantation and 4 in primary<br><br>undisturbed forests adjacent to the plantation. The following measurements will be made in<br><br>the 16 blocks. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Soil Carbon Inputs</p><br><br><br><br><p>LITTERFALL will be sampled monthly for 24 months and separated into foliar, stem, and<br><br>reproductive components. To measure LITTERFALL DECOMPOSITION nylon mesh bags containing<br><br>litterfall will be placed within each forest type and followed over a 24 month period,<br><br>initiated twice, once in the dry season and once in the wet season. A similar technique<br><br>will be used to follow DECOMPOSITION OF STEM LITTER in two diameter classes of small<br><br>stems; <2.5 cm diameter. And 2.5 - 10 cm diameter LITTER QUALITY will be determined by<br><br>analysis of C, N, P, lignin, and cellulose contents at 3-month intervals. ROOT BIOMASS<br><br>will be sampled every other month for 12 months using soil cores. An estimate of COURSE<br><br>WOODY DEBRIS will be conducted during the dry season. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Soil Carbon Pool</p><br><br><br><br><p>Soil sampling will be done in close proximity to each litter trap by bulking a<br><br>composite of at least three samples. TOTAL SOIL CARBON will be sampled during both the wet<br><br>and dry season. LABILE/STABLE C RATIO will be analyzed from both wet and dry season<br><br>samples using a series of sonication, sieving, and densiometric separations to fractionate<br><br>various soil organic components including an "enriched labile fraction"<br><br>hypothesized to be the major organic matter pool depleted by cultivation. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Nutrient Dynamics</p><br><br><br><br><p>Extractable P, K, Al, Mg, Ca, pH, and CEC will be analyzed for soil samples taken<br><br>during both the wet and dry seasons. Soil bulk densities will be determined for wet season<br><br>samples at two depths. Total soil N will be sampled along with total soil C. Foliar litter<br><br>samples will be analyzed at 3 month intervals for C, N, P, lignin, and cellulose contents.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Site</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will conduct this study on the property of Jari Cellulose, a private enterprise<br><br>located on the Jari river, the first south flowing major tributary of the Amazon river.<br><br>This location offers an exceptionally unique situation to compare natural and artificial<br><br>systems. The company manages approximately 80,000 ha of plantations which, for the most<br><br>part, are surrounded and immediately adjacent to primary forest that has no history of<br><br>human intervention with the possible exception of extractive practices. Auburn University<br><br>has signed a research agreement with Jari Cellulose and has worked collaboratively with<br><br>the company in the past. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Schedule</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Litterfall collection April 1998 to April 2000, monthly samples</li><br><br>  <li>Litter quality Three month intervals from July 1998 to April 2000</li><br><br>  <li>Litter decomposition Two initiation points - April 1998 and October 1998, 18 months<br><br>    duration</li><br><br>  <li>Root coring October 1998 to October 1999, monthly</li><br><br>  <li>Coarse Woody Debris October 1998</li><br><br>  <li>Soil N and C October 1998 and April 1999</li><br><br>  <li>Soil chemistry October 1998</li><br><br>  <li>Soil bulk density April 1999</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Ken McNabb: Project coordinator, silva-culture and management</li><br><br>  <li>Graeme Lockaby: Soil carbon dynamics, biogeochemistry</li><br><br>  <li>Luiz G. da Silva: Carbon and nutrient cycling</li><br><br></ul></span>
