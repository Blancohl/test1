<span class="default-style"><p>This project began prior to the LBA call for proposals, and is funded by NASA's New<br><br>Investigator Program. Thus, this abstract will be slightly different than most of the<br><br>others in that we will briefly outline relevant work already accomplished as well as list<br><br>our future plans. The majority of our work is in the Santarem/Tapajos region (lat/long:<br><br>3S, 56W).</p><br><br><br><br><p> <font SIZE="4"><b>Project Goals</b></font> </p><br><br><br><br><p> The overall objectives of this project can be divided into three main areas: </p><br><br><br><br><p> 1) Process-level measurements of biogeochemical patterns following conversion of<br><br>moist tropical forest to pasture, with an emphasis on changes in P, Ca, Mg, K and their<br><br>effects on C and N cycles. This work is being done along two pasture-age gradients south<br><br>of Santarem; one on high clay soils (avg. 54% clay), and one on extremely sandy soils<br><br>(avg. 92% sand).</p><br><br><br><br><p> 2) Remote sensing- Biogeochemistry links, including (a) regionalization of<br><br>pasture biogeochemical information using high-spatial resolution Landsat TM data and a<br><br>radiative transfer inverse modeling technique, (b) analysis of seasonal trends in pasture<br><br>vs. forest canopy greenness and energy absorption using an AVHRR spectral unmixing method,<br><br>and (c) analysis of the biotic response of the uncleared areas of the Amazon Basin to<br><br>inter-annual climate variability.</p><br><br><br><br><p> 3) Estimates of how tropical land conversion affects the use of atmospheric <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>data as a tracer of regional fluxes in the global carbon cycle.</p><br><br><br><br><p> <font SIZE="4">Brief Synopsis of Progress to Date</p><br><br></font><br><br><br><br><p>As mentioned above, we are focusing on the Santarem region, where we have established<br><br>several sites that comprise pasture age gradients (2-15 years old) on two soil types (sand<br><br>and clay). Data from these sites show a suite of biogeochemical changes as pastures age,<br><br>including substantial losses of soil organic matter, N, P, Ca, Mg and K. In addition,<br><br>while both soils demonstrate these declines, there are significant differences at every<br><br>pasture age between the soil types. Preliminary foliar data from pasture grasses suggest<br><br>that the strongest increases in nutrient limitation are in N, P and Ca. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Early results from radiative transfer (RT) model inversions using both field-collected<br><br>spectral data and satellite optical data suggest that changes in productivity (NPP) and<br><br>biomass which accompany changes in biogeochemistry can be resolved at regional scales<br><br>using satellite data, thereby allowing much more meaningful spatial and temporal analyses<br><br>of land use effects on carbon and nutrient cycles than can be approached using standard<br><br>remote sensing classification or ground techniques alone. We are also finishing a<br><br>basin-level analysis of inter-annual variability in NPP, linked to precipitation anomalies<br><br>associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These results show significant<br><br>inter-annual variability of Amazon moist forest physiology and carbon uptake which, when<br><br>combined with carbon efflux data from land cover / land use change analyses by other<br><br>groups, may change our perspective on spatial and temporal variation in sources and sinks<br><br>of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Finally, we have used data and modeled simulations of changes in <sup>13</sup>C of<br><br>respired CO<sub>2 </sub>following deforestation, along with continental-scale databases of<br><br>land cover change for the last 30 years (eg. Houghton's data), to estimate the current<br><br>imbalance in atmosphere-biosphere exchange of <sup>13</sup>C that is due to tropical land<br><br>conversion. We have then made preliminary calculations of how this imbalance, or<br><br>"dis-equilibrium", affects atmospheric <sup>13</sup>C-based estimates of global<br><br>terrestrial vs. oceanic net fluxes of CO<sub>2 </sub>(cf. Ciais et al 1995, Francey et al.<br><br>1995). Our preliminary results suggest that this land-use dis-equilibrium must be taken<br><br>into account, as incorporation of our estimate into the Francey et al (1995) analysis<br><br>changed their partitioning of terrestrial vs. oceanic exchange by an average of 0.65<br><br>GtC/yr. This change manifests itself primarily as an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by<br><br>terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics.</p><br><br><br><br><p> <font SIZE="4">Current Activities (spring 98)</p><br><br></font><br><br><br><br><p> 1) Continued work on the biogeochemistry of our pasture sites, including<br><br>Hedley-style fractionations of soil P, potential N mineralization, and foliar lignin<br><br>analyses.</p><br><br><br><br><p>2) RT inversions of TM data to see if the limited spectral information in the latter<br><br>can still provide information on changes in biomass and NPP with pasture age</p><br><br><br><br><p>3) Regional estimates of pasture LAI and NPP at TM scale-resolution for the<br><br>Santarem/Tapajos region</p><br><br><font SIZE="4"><br><br><br><br><p>Future Plans (summer 98 - spring 00)</p><br><br></font><br><br><br><br><p><strong> Pasture Biogeochemistry:</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p>We are planning at least 3 more trips to the Tapajos sites; these trips will be timed<br><br>so that we can collect data in both dry and wet seasons. We plan to supplement the data we<br><br>have on soil and foliar C, N, P and base cation content with repeated measurements of<br><br>several more dynamic variables, including using ion exchange resin bags to measure<br><br>availability of N, P and base cations in both wet and dry seasons in all pasture sites. We<br><br>will also measure dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) in soil solution<br><br>in both wet and dry seasons, and plan to install several Prenart tension lysimeters in a<br><br>subset of the pastures as a pilot experiment to look at leachate losses of all the above<br><br>elements. In addition, we are planning a series of small-scale fertilization experiments<br><br>in forest and pasture sites to investigate microbial nutrient limitation. Finally, we are<br><br>planning a number of isotopic measurements aimed at understanding rates of organic matter<br><br>turnover and loss in these pastures. In collaboration with Jason Neff (Stanford Univ.), we<br><br>will measure <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C of bulk soil carbon, fractionated SOM, soil<br><br>CO<sub>2</sub>, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forests and pastures on both soil<br><br>types. We will also repeat the foliar analyses we've already done in the wet season, and<br><br>will measure aboveground biomass of pasture grasses in both wet and dry seasons. </p><br><br><br><br><p><strong> Remote Sensing:</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p>In addition to continued work on the projects outlined above, we are actively planning<br><br>to use MODIS, MISR and ASTER data when it becomes available in 1999. We intend to<br><br>spectrally unmix the MODIS data to recover pasture and forest reflectance signatures. Due<br><br>to the daily 1km-resolution coverage of MODIS, we think that the analyses of land-cover<br><br>phenology and NPP will be greatly improved using this instrument. MISR data will aid in<br><br>determining the degree of aerosol and water vapor contamination which has been a constant<br><br>problem with the currently available AVHRR data. Using both MODIS and MISR, we will<br><br>improve estimates of greenness, canopy energy absorption, and NPP. Concurrent AVHRR data<br><br>may also allow for retrocalibration of at least the more recent AVHRR data.</p><br><br><br><br><p>ASTER data will be used in conjunction with Landsat 7 data to continue the inverse<br><br>modeling--biogeochemistry effort. Both of these datasets will be critical for spectral<br><br>unmixing of the MODIS data. Unmixed MODIS data also has the potential to be used for RT<br><br>inverse modeling, particularly due to its SWIR (1300-2500 nm) spectral coverage (Asner et<br><br>al. in review). The SWIR range contains significant information on bare soil extent and<br><br>canopy litter fraction (Asner 1998), and we are working as part of the Schimel EOS IDS<br><br>group to develop the algorithms needed to retrieve critical pasture canopy characteristics<br><br>using unmixed MODIS data.<br></span>
