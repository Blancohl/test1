<span class="default-style"><p>Hypotheses and Cautions</p><br><br><br><br><p>We assert several points about the atmospheric environment of LBA-ECO, which appear<br><br>reasonable. Only newly funded work under LBA-ECO will allow us to test these and to<br><br>aid the ecological community with their interpretation of atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>,<br><br>CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>0, and aerosols, as well as assessments of carbon loss<br><br>from Amazônia. </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <p>1. The atmospheric environment of the LBAE study area will be affected by inflow of<br><br>    outside air in the lower troposphere, and the inflow will be greatest during the rainiest<br><br>    seasons. These will at least dilute the concentrations of trace species like nitrous<br><br>    oxide, methane, isoprene carbon monoxide natural particulate matter, etc. The rainy season<br><br>    period will also be the period of the most dramatic vertical stirring, e.g., by cloud<br><br>    downdrafts, with similar effects. See also the MTPE proposal, attached, especially the<br><br>    front page, showing strong effects even during the dry season. </p><br><br>    <p>2. Composition of the inflow air is complex. For example, in March and April, there is<br><br>    inflow of air from clean ocean regions to portions of Amazônia. However, significant<br><br>    inflow from northernmost South America and the Caribbean, and also more southern regions<br><br>    of South America occurs. All these regions have burning or industrial pollution during<br><br>    these times. The largest potential inflow of complex, polluted, air is, however, from<br><br>    nearby subSaharan Africa, which is at the height of its burning season. As the preliminary<br><br>    work of the citation indicates, these effects may be sporadic and poorly quantified at<br><br>    this point, but are not to be neglected. </p><br><br>    <p>3. The loss of isoprene and other organics from the Amazônian system provides a gross<br><br>    loss of C from the system, 1.5% to 4% of NPP. Such percentage affects the perception of an<br><br>    agrading ecosystem when periods of 25 to 100 years are considered. CO may constitute 15%<br><br>    to 60% of the "final" products of isoprene oxidation; here, final means that the<br><br>    material can escape the Amazônian region. Other species may rapidly stick to surfaces or<br><br>    be rained out, possibly somewhat downwind. Measurements of CO and organic trace gases in<br><br>    CLAIRE and organic aerosols and condensibles by Paulo Artaxo at various times will inform<br><br>    our estimates of C loss from Amazônia. </p><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>Abstract of Proposed Work</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose to: </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <p>1. Compare and improve simulations of the chemical composition of the troposphere over<br><br>    Amazônia as made by American and Brazilian scientists using meteorological mesoscale and<br><br>    larger scale models. USP and Ames scientist have selected past periods of intensive<br><br>    measurement for intercomparison (e.g.. SCARB and ABLE periods). One focus of this work is<br><br>    to compare quantitatively the effects of parameterizations of planetary boundary layer and<br><br>    cloud venting. </p><br><br>    <p>2. Allow inferences of the perturbation of the Amazônia lowermost troposphere by<br><br>    outside influences. We will use incisive tracer simulations to highlight expected<br><br>    perturbations on methane, nitrous oxide. Since effects on these long-lived species will be<br><br>    small, and small concentration differences due to transport may nevertheless be used to<br><br>    infer large effects, we will also simulate carbon monoxide, smoke aerosol mass, and<br><br>    perhaps NO / N0<sub>2</sub>. In addition to the climatic interest in these species, they<br><br>    highlight exchange processes in great detail, and some of these species may be remotely<br><br>    sensed. </p><br><br>    <p>3. As measurements accumulate during the LBA period, we expect we can start studies<br><br>    describing the role of isoprene, other non-methane arboreal emissions, and their products<br><br>    on the carbon balance of Amazônia. These studies serve two purposes: they help define the<br><br>    CO export from that rainforest region to the world during seasons of low worldwide<br><br>    burning, and they affect the Amazônian C and N budgets at a significant level. This level<br><br>    of funding does not allow chemical mechanistic studies of isoprene's return to the<br><br>    ecosystem, but it does allow: </p><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>Initial studies of the isoprene profiles and concentrations using planetary boundary<br><br>        layer 1d models and thus some information on the isoprene flux from a forest and the<br><br>        location of the "stickiest" gases and aerosols relative to forest surfaces.</li><br><br>      <li>Large-scale studies of carbon flux from the Amazon based on estimated conversion<br><br>        efficiencies to CO, generically "sticky" organics, or aerosols.</li><br><br>      <li> Comparisons of observations and measurements will occupy later years of the<br><br>        proposal. Any students involved will need to familiarize themselves with the modeling and<br><br>        chemistry from an early stage of the LBA-E program cycle.</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p><b> </p><br><br><br><br><p>Last Updated:</b> September 1998 </p></span>
