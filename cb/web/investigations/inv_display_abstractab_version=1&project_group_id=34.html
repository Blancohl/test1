<span class="default-style"><p>We propose to investigate trace gas fluxes and aerosol concentrations and composition<br><br>in several Amazonian landscapes in order to improve our understanding of how land-use<br><br>change may alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Information to be obtained<br><br>will be relevant in two LBA-ECO theme areas: 1) trace gas fluxes and 2) carbon storage<br><br>and exchange. <br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>We will employ a strategy that integrates field measurements of chemical fluxes,<br><br>satellite measurements and ground observations of landscape characteristics, and<br><br>atmospheric chemistry and transport modeling (Note that only field flux measurements are<br><br>funded through LBA-ECO). We propose to substantially improve estimates of trace gas<br><br>fluxes (CO, VOC, O3, NOx) and aerosol concentrations associated with major<br><br>Amazonian landscapes and to use a digital geographical information system (GIS) with<br><br>numerical models of atmospheric chemistry and transport to quantify the impact of land-use<br><br>change in Amazonia on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Trace Gas Fluxes</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose to characterize trace gas fluxes and aerosol concentrations over a range of<br><br>landscapes and land-use types and improve our understanding of the surface and chemical<br><br>sources and sinks of these compounds. We will measure fluxes of CO, NOx and volatile<br><br>organic compounds (VOC) at four LBA flux towers for a period of 7-10 days each, using a<br><br>relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system. Thirty minute integrated air samples associated<br><br>with up and down eddies will be collected into teflon bags or adsorbent cartridges and<br><br>analyzed for CO, CH4, isoprene, monoterpenes, methanol and other oxygenated<br><br>VOC, and NOx, all of which play a major role in tropospheric photochemistry. If isoprene<br><br>fluxes are sufficiently large to warrant further study, we have the capability of<br><br>continuously measuring isoprene flux using eddy covariance techniques with a<br><br>chemiluminescence fast isoprene analyzer.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>In addition to tower REA studies, vertical profiles of chemical species (CO2,<br><br>CO, O3, NOx, VOC) will be measured at several heights between the surface and 2<br><br>km above ground level using a tethered balloon sampling system. Fluxes will be estimated<br><br>using mixed-layer gradient and mass balance techniques.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Organic aerosols play an important role in biogeochemical cycling of a variety of<br><br>elements, and influence the hydrological cycle and climate through their role as cloud<br><br>condensation nuclei. Atmospheric aerosol composition will be measured at three tower<br><br>sites. Fine (<2.0 mm diameter) and coarse (2.0 mm) aerosol fractions will be collected<br><br>using stacked filter units, and concentrations and size distributions of aerosols will be<br><br>determined. Trace elemental composition will be determined. Organic acids, nitrate and<br><br>sulfate, and major anions and cations will be measured in selected samples using ion<br><br>chromatography.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Trace gas flux estimates will be incorporated into a 3-D atmospheric chemistry and<br><br>transport model and used to predict the potential impact of land cover change on the<br><br>chemical composition of the atmosphere. Trace gas flux estimates will be coupled with a<br><br>3-D global atmospheric chemistry model, MOZART (Model of Ozone And Related Species in the<br><br>Troposphere), that will be used to examine the impact of changes in trace gas fluxes on<br><br>the chemical composition of the troposphere. MOZART is a fully diurnal model that<br><br>calculates the distribution and time evolution of approximately 50 chemical species from<br><br>the surface to the upper stratosphere. An explicit goal in the development of MOZART is to<br><br>provide a modeling tool for assessing how changes in trace gas fluxes, due to land-use<br><br>modifications, will impact global chemical budgets. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Carbon Storage and Exchange</p><br><br><br><br><p>The major flux of carbon between the atmosphere and the land surface is in the form of<br><br>CO2. However, there is a net efflux of carbon from forested ecosystems in the<br><br>form of trace gases and organic aerosols which is undetected using the proposed eddy<br><br>covariance CO2 flux techniques. The contribution of CO and VOC to the net<br><br>ecosystem exchange of carbon will be quantified at four tower CO2 flux sites,<br><br>using the REA system described above. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>Alex Guenther: Management and REA and tethered balloon flux measurements</li><br><br>      <li>Paulo Artaxo: Aerosol size distribution and composition</li><br><br>      <li>Brad Baker, University of Colorado: REA flux measurements and oxygenated VOC analysis</li><br><br>      <li>Bill Baugh, NCAR: Landscape characterization and tethered balloon flux measurements</li><br><br>      <li>Guy Brasseur: Atmospheric chemistry and transport modeling</li><br><br>      <li>Ken Davis, University of Minnesota: Mixed-layer gradient flux estimation</li><br><br>      <li>Jim Greenberg: Trace gas analyses and tethered balloon flux measurements</li><br><br>      <li>Peter Harley: REA flux measurements and VOC enclosure flux studies</li><br><br>      <li>Lee Klinger: Landscape characterization and NOx analysis</li><br><br>      <li>Pérola Vasconcellos, University of São Paulo: Ambient VOC and aerosol measurements</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>Preferred Sites</p><br><br><br><br><p>We hope to make REA trace gas flux measurements from four CO2 flux towers,<br><br>representing a range of land-use types, including primary and second-growth forest.
