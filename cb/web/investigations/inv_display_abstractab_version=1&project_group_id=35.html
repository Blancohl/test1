<span class="default-style"><p class="MsoBodyText">We propose to continue monitoring aerosol optical<br><br>properties, water vapor, and surface irradiance within our existing network. <br><br>Our highly successful network currently includes eight established sites,<br><br>with seven located in the Amazon basin, that have provided regular measurements<br><br>at some locations since the early phase of the LBA project dating back to<br><br>January 1999.  Further observations<br><br>will enhance the multi-year dataset already acquired, and allow for a<br><br>comprehensive study of inter-annual variability of aerosol optical properties<br><br>(biomass-burning and background aerosols) both seasonally and spatially.</p><br><br><p class="MsoBodyText">We plan to continue our studies of the attenuation of<br><br>broadband irradiance by biomass burning aerosols across the region.  These studies have produced two LBA related journals papers to date. <br><br>At least two funded LBA investigators are producing surface irradiance<br><br>products from satellite data, and they will be relying on our flux measurements<br><br>for validation of their products and on our AOD data for smoke attenuation<br><br>analyses.</p><br><br><p class="MsoBodyText">Our previous studies have presented fractional reductions<br><br>in expected flux due to smoke, and we now plan to also assess the radiative<br><br>effects of clouds at all our network sites.  MODIS cloud products (fractional coverage and optical thickness<br><br>parameters) will be used with the observed local irradiance reductions to<br><br>develop algorithms for estimating cloud attenuation of surface flux.  The large spatial aspect of MODIS data will allow us to scale our point<br><br>source observations to a basin-wide quantification of cloud effect.  The characterization of diurnal trends in cloud attenuation, which varies<br><br>greatly with month, will provide time-of-day corrections that can be applied to<br><br>MODIS observations.  The accuracy of<br><br>MODIS measurements, necessarily limited to a short duration, can thus be<br><br>improved for application to non-overpass periods of the day.</p><br><br><p class="MsoBodyText">Collection of additional aerosol properties data sets<br><br>from our LBA network will enable us to study the regional aerosol optical<br><br>properties in detail and to investigate seasonal trends. We plan to investigate<br><br>possible differences in aerosol single scattering albedo and size distribution<br><br>between sites in central Amazonia versus in the southern arc of deforestation,<br><br>that may result due to differences in the severity of the dry season and thus<br><br>differences in fuel moisture content. Additionally, seasonal trends in aerosol<br><br>absorption at each site will be studied, which may result from differences in<br><br>transport and aging of aerosols and in the fuel moisture as the dry season<br><br>transitions to the wet season.</p><br><br><p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to our permanent installations, a number of<br><br>additional CIMEL sunphotometer and flux sensors will be deployed in support of<br><br>intensive field campaigns planned for the next two years (SMOCC, Dry-to-Wet<br><br>Season Field Campaign (August-November 2002)) with Brazilian and European<br><br>collaborators.   A micro-pulse<br><br>lidar (providing details of vertical aerosol distribution), 4-5 additional CIMEL<br><br>sun-sky radiometers, and a temporary network of 20-30 hand-held sunphotometers<br><br>will be operated in Rondônia during select experiments.</p></span>
