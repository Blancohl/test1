<span class="default-style">   Our proposed efforts are split into four related tasks:<br>1) Completing data analysis and developing a data base, CD-03 observations, LBA-ECO;<br><br>This work draws on data obtained at twelve different field sites near Santarém PA and specified measurements at ZF-2 Manaus.<br>2) Assessing measurements of net ecosystem carbon and energy exchanges in Amazônia; A methodology to link direct measurements of canopy structure to light <br>and momentum penetration into the canopy is proposed.  This would allow bulk properties of the forest to be inferred from physical measurements.  A plan for understanding measurements of subcanopy wind speeds is described, and support is requested to develop a model to predict the intensity of subcanopy drainage flows that could be used in concert with estimates of soil respiration to predict horizontal advection of CO2.<br>3) Determining the regional impact of conversion from pasture to rice and soybean production in the Tapajós region of western Pará state, Brazil. Completing analysis of carbon and water exchanges at an evolving agricultural site is proposed.  We propose to apply our understanding of nocturnal mixing processes to allow for reanalysis of flux estimates reported at less instrumented field sites.<br>4) Examining the mesoclimatic influences of river proximity in the Amazon at LBA-ECO and other sites.  A special focus will be on how these effects are expressed currently and how they may be altered with expected future land cover changes. This effort aims to consolidate the observations of the Santarém mesoclimate and expand the approach to encompass two other flux tower sites.  Data from standard weather stations will be acquired.  The degree to which proximity of a station to the river introduces to climatological means of rainfall, wind speed, radiation and temperature will be found.  Data sets will be prepared to aid mesoscale modelers to quantify this effect.</span>
