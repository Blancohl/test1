<span class="default-style">Our objective is to complete the analysis of extensive biometric and micrometeorological data sets we collected during LBA-ECO at the selectively logged site in Tapajos National Forest (TNF), Brazil.  We will compare with similar measurements from a nearby forest site that was not logged to determine the effects of selective logging on carbon dioxide and energy exchange between a tropical rainforest and the atmosphere.  The analysis will involve collaboration with other groups working in TNF, particularly at the unlogged tower site.  We will attempt to scale up our single-site results on the effects of logging to larger scales based on the results of remote sensing groups.  We will complete analyses aimed to better understand the physiology and physics of plant carbon-dioxide exchange.  Intensive leaf-level measurements will be used to determine controls on photosynthesis and respiration.  Our work using nighttime satellite imagery to infer patterns of cold-air drainage (a large source of uncertainty for tower-based measures of forest carbon balance) will be expanded to include other LBA tower sites.  We will process and analyze data collected from a tower to be installed in June 2005 that will replace a tower lost in 2004 during a storm.  We will participate in LBA tower synthesis efforts and workshops.  </span>
