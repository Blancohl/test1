<span class="default-style">Recent work by the CD-06 project on the overall patterns and dynamics of pCO2 in Amazonian waters has confirmed and expended upon our perspectives of the overall importance of fluvial outgassing in the Amazon carbon budget.  While provocative, these early results represent a work in progress; much remains to be done. It is  important to be able to track processes from a local source to downstream aggregation.. Models are needed to be able to express river chemistry in explicit, process-based terms of the attributes of the landscape, and the movement of water through the landscape. The overall objective of the work proposed here is to determine the sequence of processes, from small to large scales, which defines the role of fluvial systems in the C cycle of the Amazon. To conduct the data synthesis and modeling activities, we propose a set of 4 tasks. Task 1 is to conduct 2 integration workshops, as “bookends” on the project. The workshops will include short courses, data integration, and formulation of model algorithms, with the outcomes of papers and a book. Task 2 is to complete and integrate cross-system field data into the modeling environment. Task 3 is to establish a “Virtual Scaleable Basin” modeling and cyber-informatics infrastructure, and to incorporate a fine-scale solute export model, a scaling hydrology model, and a net ecosystem production module (NPP), all driven by surface forcing. With Task 4, we will be able to evaluate coupled the carbon and hydrologic dynamics of the Amazon Basin, under current and changing conditions.  </span>
