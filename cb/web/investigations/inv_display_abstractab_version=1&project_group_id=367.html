<span class="default-style">     As phase III of our LBA-ECO investigation, we propose to complete our multi-temporal, multi-scale analyses of inundation and aquatic vegetation dynamics based on our accumulated multi-year set of Radarsat, Envisat and MODIS data complemented by JERS-1 and Landsat data.  This work will connect directly to measurements and modeling of carbon dynamics of wetland systems throughout the Amazon with particular emphasis on the floodplains of the central basin, the interfluvial wetlands of the Negro basin and reservoirs.  Field studies of methane and carbon dioxide emissions and aquatic macrophyte phenology and biomass, completed in 2005 by our research team and other groups with whom we collaborate, will be combined with our remote sensing results to calculate regional fluxes.<br><br>     Our remote sensing and field studies will provide information essential for the following integrative and modeling activities: (1) Calculations of regional carbon dioxide and methane emissions based on the combination of remotely sensed inundation and wetland vegetation with measurements of dissolved gas concentrations (collaborative with LBA-ECO Richey/Victoria team); and (2) Development of a model of methane production and emission (collaboratively with LBA-ECO Potter/Cavalho and Foley/Costa teams) that incorporates our remotely sensed information on inundation and aquatic vegetation and uses our field measurements of evasion for validation.<br><br></span>
