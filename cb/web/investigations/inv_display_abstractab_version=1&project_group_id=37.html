<span class="default-style"><p>The Amazon region includes the largest remaining tropical forest<br><br>    ecosystem on Earth.  Despite the Amazon’s potential importance for<br><br>    climate regulation, the precise pattern of a terrestrial sources and sinks<br><br>    for CO2 and other “greenhouse gas” compounds like methane remain<br><br>    uncertain for the region.  These large gaps in our knowledge still<br><br>    exist to a great degree because many impacts of land cover change and<br><br>    geochemical controls related to surface hydrology have not been understood<br><br>    in adequate detail to determine precise regional fluxes for biogenic trace<br><br>    gases.  Therefore, the fundamental approach we propose for LBA-ECO II<br><br>    research involves integrated studies and predictive modeling for Amazon<br><br>    carbon, water, and nutrient cycles using a regional ecosystem model called<br><br>    NASA-CASA (Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach), which has been uniquely<br><br>    developed and applied using satellite data drivers as a component of the<br><br>    NASA LBA-ECO I program.  Our proposed work thereby builds upon over<br><br>    four years of coordinated data assimilation and model development, as part<br><br>    of the LBA Science Team.  The research plan we now propose is designed<br><br>    to extend the value of new LBA site (tower and small plot flux) data and<br><br>    remote sensing products by up-scaling with NASA-CASA to the regional level<br><br>    using a variety of different land cover products available for the Amazon<br><br>    region.  In this manner, we propose to make new linkages in LBA-ECO<br><br>    project science between site-based investigation and regional scale modeling<br><br>    and remote sensing.       </p><br><br>    <p>A unique aspect of our study approach is to treat land cover<br><br>    inputs to our ecosystem carbon modeling as variable  according to time,<br><br>    spatial scale, and spatial resolution.  In the proposed research plan,<br><br>    the NASA-CASA ecosystem model will make a series of simulation runs using<br><br>    multiple sequences of land cover change for the entire Amazon regional<br><br>    extent.  The simulations will include the following land cover/land use<br><br>    class settings  -- moist primary forest, dry primary forest,<br><br>    drought-deciduous forest, savanna, disturbed (burned), secondary forest,<br><br>    pasture, and annual crop.  Nominal spatial resolution for hydro-meteorologic<br><br>    inputs to our LBA regional simulations will be 8x8 km pixel size.  The<br><br>    percentage cover-weighted results from these individual model runs for land<br><br>    cover change sequences will be aggregated to reconstruct a history of<br><br>    regional heterogeneity in Amazon ecosystem dynamics.  Trace gas fluxes<br><br>    (e.g., CO2, N2O) will be weighted by land cover change frequency<br><br>    distributions derived from the highest spatial resolution data available<br><br>    (e.g., from MODIS and Landsat sensors) for the entire region and for<br><br>    selected smaller areas around intensive LBA studies.  High resolution<br><br>    (< 1-km) land cover images for 'footprint' areas of LBA tower sites will<br><br>    be used to define the proportions of each land cover class with which to<br><br>    weight ecosystem model estimates and validate against measured tower fluxes<br><br>    of carbon and water exchange.  Particular emphasis will be placed on<br><br>    Tapajós National Forest (TNF) tower sites, where our Brazilian<br><br>    co-investigators are actively making field measurements of energy, water,<br><br>    and carbon exchange, which are vital to ecosystem model evaluation.    </p><br><br>    <p>A second integrative aspect of this study will be to extend<br><br>    NASA-CASA model predictions of carbon and trace gas fluxes to (seasonally)<br><br>    inundated areas of the region.  Through close collaboration with other<br><br>    LBA investigator teams whose studies have developed or used radar remote<br><br>    sensing products or surface water models, we will adapt our CASA model to<br><br>    include Amazon mainstem and floodplain dynamics, with focus on up-scaling<br><br>    wetland ecosystem methane and CO2  emission fluxes.  At the<br><br>    smaller scale of the TNF watershed, we will complete the development of a<br><br>    new parameterization scheme within the NASA-CASA model for coupling a<br><br>    surface water routing model called HYDRA (Univ. Wisconsin), and validating<br><br>    simulations of surface water flow against measured flow and dissolved carbon<br><br>    chemistry of the Rio Moju discharge network from the TNF.</p></span>
