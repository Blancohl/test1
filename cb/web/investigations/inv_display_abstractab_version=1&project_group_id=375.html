<span class="default-style">Building on 33 years of research experience in the Amazon, this study will advance our understanding of land cover and land use change (LCLUC) and what trajectories will lead the region towards a sustainable path in both social and environmental terms.  This project builds on a seven-region study, along the LBA transects, supported for nine years by NSF, NOAA and NIH funding, and for the past seven years by LBA funds. In this final phase of LBA, we propose to upscale from our detailed studies of human-environment interactions at these seven sites by examining LCLUC dynamics at county level in a total of 135 municipios, then aggregate these municipios data into two meso-regions, one in Para (ca. 672,200 km2), and the other in Rondonia (ca. 130,479 km2), and then to the entire two states (1,239,800 km2 and 239,400km2 respectively) to achieve our goals.  We take advantage of data collected for several years using a nested-georeferenced approach including soil analyses, vegetation stand structure and composition (100+ sites), land use histories, institutional analyses, demography of 900+ households, and land cover classification using multi-temporal remote sensing data since 1970. The seven regions in our study represent a soil fertility gradient across Amazonia from most (i.e. alfisols) to least (i.e. spodosols) fertile and include a wide array of landscapes being transformed by human action along an east-to-west transect, extending from the Amazon estuary and the Bragantina region east of Belem, all the way to Rondonia in the west.  </span>
