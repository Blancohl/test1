<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style" style="mso-line-height-alt:1.0pt;tab-stops:.5in"><br><br>We propose to continue investigating the effects of selective logging on the<br><br>exchanges of CO2 and energy by a primary forest in the Tapajos National Forest (TNF),<br><br>Pará. Our study can be thought of as a large experimental manipulation, where<br><br>we use a range of techniques, including eddy covariance, to monitor forest<br><br>physiology before, during, and after selective logging.</p><br><br><p class="default-style" style="mso-line-height-alt:1.0pt;tab-stops:.5in"><br><br>We have been making eddy covariance measurements, and ground-based measurements<br><br>of soil respiration, litterfall, wood increment, and coarse woody debris, at the<br><br>Santarem km-83 site since 2000. As of March 2002 we had collected, and submitted<br><br>to Beija-Flor, 20 months of nearly continuous tower-flux observations.  The<br><br>first 14 months of observations were made while the forest was relatively<br><br>undisturbed.  These data served as the basis for three submitted<br><br>manuscripts that detail the exchanges of CO2 and energy by the intact forest.<br><br>The remaining 6 months of observations were made after the forest was<br><br>selectively logged in September 2001. The logging operation, which was conducted<br><br>by a local firm using reduced impact procedures, covered ~400-ha of forest that<br><br>extended ~2-km upwind of the tower. The loggers removed only ~6% of the biomass<br><br>in large trees, but left another ~18% of the biomass in large trees as slash,<br><br>and eliminated ~13% of the canopy on an area basis.  Preliminary analysis<br><br>of the tower observations indicate that canopy photosynthesis declined by ~15%<br><br>following logging, and that ecosystem respiration increased in the subsequent<br><br>wet season. </p><br><br><p class="default-style" style="mso-line-height-alt:1.0pt;tab-stops:.5in;<br><br>mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none;<br><br>vertical-align:baseline"><br><br>In this proposal we request support to complete our study by continuing these<br><br>observations for three more years.  Our goal is to use the combined tower<br><br>and ground-based observations to quantify the forest’s response to, and<br><br>recovery from, logging. We will do this in collaboration with other researchers<br><br>working in Santarem, and, in particular those making flux measurements at the<br><br>km-67 tower (CD10, Wofsy PI; TG07, Keller and Crill PIs), which serves as an<br><br>undisturbed control for the km-83 tower, and those making additional<br><br>measurements at the km-83 tower (TG07, Keller and Crill PIs; CD03 Fitzjarrald<br><br>PI, and TG04,  Martens PI).  Additionally, we will focus efforts on<br><br>scientific integration within LBA, both among researchers working in Santarem,<br><br>and among all tower groups within LBA.  Finally, we will continue our<br><br>educational activities by further involving Brazilian students in the research,<br><br>both at UCI and USP, as well as in Santarem.</p></span>
