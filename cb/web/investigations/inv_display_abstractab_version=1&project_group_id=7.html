<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>Photosynthesis and respiration by vegetation and soil play a vital role in the carbon<br><br>cycle over the rain forest in the Amaz么nia region. Among various key factors in<br><br>determining these physiological processes by models are photosynthetically active<br><br>radiation (PAR), and the canopy and soil temperatures (Tc , Ts). For example, it has been<br><br>suggested that the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rates over the Amazon forest may be highly<br><br>sensitive to radiation and temperature. That the system may change from a sink to a source<br><br>in response to reduced radiation levels due to cloud cover or an average temperature rise<br><br>of a degree or less. However, our knowledge of the space-time distribution of PAR and Tc<br><br>is too incomplete to facilitate large-scale comprehensive modeling studies. The data<br><br>currently available for Amaz么nia come from only a few sites, and thus past studies of<br><br>this kind have been restricted to specific time periods and areas. Moreover, extrapolation<br><br>of datasets to larger spatial scales and longer time periods may not be appropriate<br><br>because of discontinuous processes controlling PAR and Tc. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Scientific Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>This proposal address these concerns with the following four main scientific<br><br>objectives: </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <p><b>1. </b>Retrieval of the surface radiation budget over the large-scale Amazon basin,<br><br>    including retrieval of PAR, Tc, and Ts, based on GOES-8 satellite measurements; </p><br><br>    <p><b>2</b>. Examination of net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange between the atmosphere and the<br><br>    soil-forest ecosystem as a function of land type and land-use based on a biosphere model<br><br>    forced with satellite-derived inputs; </p><br><br>    <p><b>3. </b>Analysis of the basin-wide spatial and temporal variability of net CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>    exchange; </p><br><br>    <p><b>4.</b> Quantification of the effects of distribution of environmental variables such as<br><br>    cloudiness, boundary layer thermodynamics, and aerosol concentration on scaling up both in<br><br>    space and time of seasonal and basin-wide CO<sub>2</sub> exchange. </p><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>Approach</p><br><br><br><br><p>Retrieval of the surface total solar fluxes and PAR fluxes is to be carried out with a<br><br>physical algorithm designed for GOES satellite measurements which has been successfully<br><br>applied to the BOREAS project. For the long-wave fluxes, we will use a new algorithm based<br><br>on the idea of energy balance for a surface layer. To obtain the canopy and soil<br><br>temperatures, we begin by retrieving surface radiometric skin temperature (Trs) from the<br><br>GOES split window channels, then employ an optimization procedure in conjunction with the<br><br>biosphere model to separate the Tc and Ts temperatures. The resulting datasets including<br><br>the SRB fluxes, PAR, Trs, Tc, Ts, and the CO<sub>2</sub> flux will be calculated over a 4<br><br>x 4-km grid at 30-minute time resolution. With these space and time resolutions, the<br><br>datasets are expected to play a vital role in various modeling studies to be undertaken<br><br>within the LBA-ECO project.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>The CO<sub>2</sub> flux modeling is to be accomplished by forcing the biosphere model<br><br>with the above-derived radiation and temperature variables. The model will incorporate one<br><br>of the following physiological parameterizations, depending on available data: (1) scaling<br><br>leaf photosynthesis, respiration, and stomatal conductance to the canopy if canopy-level<br><br>data are not available; (2) canopy-level parameterization based on light-use-efficiency if<br><br>canopy-level data are available. The main results from the modeling efforts will be<br><br>detailed time series of the various CO<sub>2</sub> flux components at the high space-time<br><br>resolutions. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Scientific Importance</p><br><br><br><br><p>This will be the first detailed, quantitative study of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange over<br><br>large-scale Amaz么nia. The study is designed to take advantage of recent advances in<br><br>physiological and biosphere modeling, and the intrinsic high space-time resolution<br><br>capabilities of the GOES Imager. One of the motivations of this study is to determine the<br><br>space-time sampling requirements needed to obtain representative estimates of CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>exchange over the Amazon basin. This process variability is controlled by the<br><br>heterogeneity of land cover, changing environmental factors in the planetary boundary<br><br>layer, and the highly variable cloud systems and aerosol plumes affecting tropical South<br><br>America.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>It is our hypothesis that representative carbon budgets cannot be obtained by<br><br>monitoring at a limited number of point sites, even if all major land classifications are<br><br>sampled, because the processes controlling boundary layer thermodynamics and cloud<br><br>formation are not ergodic and thus require frequent sampling to ensure accurate<br><br>integration. Currently, we do not quantitatively understand the sources of carbon budget<br><br>variability in the rain forest, nor the best strategy to integrate up to basin scales from<br><br>the limited amount of information currently on hand. In conducting this study over the<br><br>large-scale basin, we expect to determine the major factors controlling CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>flux exchange variability, which will help shed light on how changing climatic conditions<br><br>would be expected to alter carbon sequestering and its release in the Amaz么nia rain<br><br>forest. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Value of Results to LBA-ECO</p><br><br><br><br><p>The results are expected to contribute to the LBA-ECO scientific goals in several<br><br>ways. With high space-time resolution CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, we shall be able to estimate<br><br>the net CO<sub>2</sub> fixed by different land covers on different time scales by<br><br>integrating various components of the CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in time at selected sites.<br><br>Similarly, by integrating the CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in space, we shall be able to estimate<br><br>contributions by different land covers to basin-wide carbon accumulation. In addition,<br><br>with the high resolution radiation and temperature inputs, which are greatly affected by<br><br>cloudiness, boundary layer temperature-moisture, and aerosol concentration, we will be<br><br>able to quantify the effects of the variation of these environmental variables on scaling<br><br>up to seasonal and basin-wide scales. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li><b>Eric Smith</b>: Radiative Transfer, Biosphere Modeling, Surface Radiation Budget,<br><br>        Atmospheric Remote Sensing in Optical-Infrared-Microwave Spectrums, Analysis of Large<br><br>        Satellite Datasets</li><br><br>      <li><b>Jiujing Gu</b>: SRB/PAR Retrieval from GOES/AVHRR Satellite Measurements, Solar<br><br>        Radiative Transfer, Satellite Data Management</li><br><br>      <li><b>John Norman</b>: Biophysical Research on Plants and Environment, Carbon Budget,<br><br>        Biosphere Modeling, Surface Remote Sensing in Optical-Infrared Spectrums</li><br><br>      <li><b>Harry Cooper</b>: Biosphere Modeling, Cloud Processes, Mesoscale Modeling</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Last Updated:</b> October 1998 </p></span>
