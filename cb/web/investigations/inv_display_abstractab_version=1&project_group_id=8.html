<span class="default-style"><p class="default-style">Our overall goals are to<br><br>quantify the contributions of different components of the carbon cycle to<br><br>overall ecosystem carbon balance in Amazonian tropical forests and to undertake<br><br>process studies at a number of sites along the eastern LBA transect to<br><br>understand how and why these fluxes vary with site, season, and year. We are<br><br>dividing this work into a number of specific tasks: (1) determining the average<br><br>rate (and variability) of tree growth over the past 3 decades; (2) determining<br><br>age demographics of tree populations, using radiocarbon to determine tree age;<br><br>(3) assessing the rate of production and decomposition of dead wood debris; (4)<br><br>determining turnover rates for organic matter in soils and the mean age of C<br><br>respired from soil using radiocarbon measurements; and (5) comparing our results<br><br>with models and constructing models to predict the potential of tropical forests<br><br>to function as sources or sinks of C.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">The overall<br><br>picture of tropical forest C dynamics emerging from our Phase I studies suggests<br><br>that the fraction of gross primary production allocated to growth in these<br><br>forests is only 25-30%, as opposed to the 50% assumed by many ecosystem models. <br><br>Consequent slow tree growth rates mean greater mean tree age for a given<br><br>diameter, as reflected in our measurements and models of tree age. <br><br>Radiocarbon measurements in leaf and root litter suggest that carbon stays in<br><br>living tree biomass for several years up to a decade before being added to<br><br>soils, where decomposition is rapid. The time lags predicted from 14C, when<br><br>coupled with climate variation on similar time scales, can lead to significant<br><br>interannual variation in net ecosystem C exchange.</p><br><br><p class="default-style">In Phase II<br><br>we will continue our measurements to observe how forest C budgets can vary from<br><br>year to year with climate.  In addition to filling gaps in our stand-level<br><br>C budgets, activities we will (1) expand our efforts in integration across sites<br><br>through modeling, and (2) augment our existing measurements where needed to<br><br>facilitate modeling (through availability of continuous temperature and moisture<br><br>data), or to fill gaps in coverage of C cycle components, and (3) continue<br><br>measurements begun in the past year to study differences in C dynamics between<br><br>primary forest and other land cover types (flooded forest and cerrado). Some<br><br>more detailed physiological measurements begun by Chambers, Higuchi, Santos, and<br><br>Tribuzy at the INPA ZF2 forest and FLONA seca floresta project will continue in<br><br>Year 1.</p></span>
