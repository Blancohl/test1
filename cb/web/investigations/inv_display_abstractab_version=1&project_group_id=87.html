<span class="default-style"><p><font size="2"><b>Abstract</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">General circulation models (GCMs) are typically<br><br>used to simulate hydrometeorological processes at the seasonal-to-interannual<br><br>time scales. However, these models are not equipped to simulate the microscale<br><br>and mesoscale land-atmosphere interactions expected to be very important in<br><br>Amazonia, where convective clouds and precipitation play a key role. This is<br><br>because their grid resolution is much lower than the spatial scale of<br><br>convection, and than the landscape heterogeneity resulting from land use / land<br><br>cover change in Amazonia.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">To fulfill the major objective of this NASA<br><br>Hydrometeorological Program (namely, to improve hydrometeorological predictions<br><br>at the seasonal-to-interannual time scales), it is crucial to bridge the gap<br><br>between these scales. To do that, we propose to nest a state-of-the-art regional<br><br>climate model (which will be validated with observations collected as part of<br><br>LBA) within a state-of-the-art GCM. This two-way interactive coupled model will<br><br>offer the unique capability of simulating explicitly (at a high resolution)<br><br>convection and precipitation in Amazonia, as well as their effects on the<br><br>general circulation. It will be used to produce ensembles of multi-year<br><br>simulations for various scenarios of land use / land cover change. Because this<br><br>type of coupled model has a time step of integration of the order of minutes, it<br><br>will be possible to study the hydrometeorological processes that it simulates at<br><br>time scales varying from hours to years.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">This modeling study, which is expected to be<br><br>completed within three years, will contribute to the education of<br><br>Brazilian students and the interactions between the PI and Brazilian scientists<br><br>through a broad cooperative agreement recently developed between Rutgers<br><br>University and the University of São Paulo.<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Introduction/Justification</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">Observations suggest the existence of<br><br>landscape-induced mesoscale circulations. These circulations are generated by<br><br>surface temperature contrasts resulting from landscape discontinuities 10-200 km<br><br>wide. Numerical studies have indicated that these circulations can be as strong<br><br>as sea breezes (e.g., Avissar and Chen, 1993; Lynn et al., 1995; Avissar and<br><br>Liu, 1996).</font><br><br><p><font size="2">Clouds and precipitation associated with such<br><br>mesoscale circulations are expected to have a crucial impact on land-atmosphere<br><br>interactions. This is because clouds modify significantly the energy balance at<br><br>the ground surface by affecting the incoming solar and atmospheric radiation.<br><br>Precipitation change the soil-water content and, as a result, the water<br><br>availability for evapotranspiration and the surface energy fluxes. Furthermore,<br><br>both clouds and precipitation generated by these mesoscale circulations are not<br><br>distributed uniformly over the region in which they develop, introducing complex<br><br>nonlinear feedbacks that one cannot evaluate without the help of complex<br><br>hydrometeorological models (e.g., Avissar and Liu, 1996).</font><br><br><p><font size="2">In Amazonia, where intensive deforestation is<br><br>taking place and convection is a very important aspect of the regional<br><br>hydrometeorology, both microscale and mesoscale landscape heterogeneities<br><br>created by the contrast of undisturbed forest and agricultural areas (pasture)<br><br>are observed. Such heterogeneities are clearly seen in satellite-derived picture<br><br>of the region where the joint LBA Mesoscale Intensive Field Campaign (LBA-MIFC)<br><br>- TRMM Validation Site will take place. Preliminary simulations performed by the<br><br>PI and his research team with the Regional Climate Model Version 2 (RegCM2) and<br><br>the climate version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (ClimRAMS) over<br><br>this domain indicate a significant impact of the landscape on the precipitation<br><br>distribution and amount (unpublished). It should also be emphasized that using<br><br>satellite images of Amazonia, Cutrim et al. (1995) found a clear signal of the<br><br>impact of deforestation on cumulus clouds, supporting these preliminary modeling<br><br>results.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">As emphasized in Section III of this NRA, from<br><br>an hydrometeorological standpoint, one of the major objective of LBA is to<br><br>better understand, and possibly quantify, the impacts of land use / land cover<br><br>change in Amazonia on hydrometeorological prediction at the seasonal-to-interannual<br><br>time scale.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">General circulation models (GCMs) are typically<br><br>used to simulate hydrometeorological processes at the seasonal-to-interannual<br><br>time scales. However, these models are not yet properly equipped to account for<br><br>the very important microscale and mesoscale processes and feedbacks that occur<br><br>between the atmosphere and the ground, as a result of / land cover change. This<br><br>is because their grid resolution (of the order of hundreds of kilometers) is<br><br>much lower than the spatial scale at which land cover varies, and than the<br><br>spatial scale at which convective clouds and precipitation (which play a key<br><br>role in the hydrometeorology of Amazonia) develop (of the order of a few<br><br>kilometers).</font><br><br><p><font size="2">Therefore, to fulfill the major objective of<br><br>this NASA Program, it is crucial to bridge the gap between these scales. To do<br><br>that, two possible solutions come to mind: (i) develop a sophisticated<br><br>parameterization of land-atmosphere interactions capable of accounting for<br><br>high-resolution land-cover variation (and associated microscale and mesoscale<br><br>hydrometeorological processes), which then would need to be introduced in a GCM<br><br>and run for the relevant time scale; or (ii) develop a sophisticated model,<br><br>capable of resolving microscale and mesoscale hydrometeorological processes (at<br><br>least over the region of interest), and at the same time be also capable of<br><br>simulating the general circulation at the relevant time scale.<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Research Objectives</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">We propose to use the latter approach, namely to<br><br>nest a state-of-the-art regional climate model (which will be validated with<br><br>observations collected as part of LBA) within a state-of-the-art GCM. This<br><br>two-way interactive coupled model will offer the unique capability of simulating<br><br>explicitly (at a high resolution) convection and precipitation in Amazonia, as<br><br>well as their effects on the general circulation. It will be used to produce<br><br>ensembles of multi-year simulations for various scenarios of land use / land<br><br>cover change. Because this type of coupled model has a time step of integration<br><br>of the order of minutes, it will be possible to study the hydrometeorological<br><br>processes that it simulates at time scales varying from hours to years.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">The two models to be coupled are (i) the climate<br><br>version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (ClimRAMS); and (ii) the<br><br>NASA - Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) GCM. Both models are<br><br>well-known, well-documented, and quite robust. The PI has been working with RAMS<br><br>for many years, and he was on sabbatical at GISS, where he learned the GISS GCM.<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Methodology</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">The proposed study will consist of three tasks,<br><br>to be accomplished within three years (estimated time for each task is given in<br><br>parenthesis).<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Task 1: Evaluation of ClimRAMS (1.5 year)</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">For this purpose, we propose to use the data<br><br>sets being collected as part of the LBA campaign. An important feature available<br><br>in ClimRAMS for this particular project, is its two-way nesting capability,<br><br>which will be used here to simulate up to five embedded grids: (i) A<br><br>very-low-resolution grid covering a large part of the South-American continent<br><br>and part of the oceans surrounding it; (ii) A low-resolution grid covering part<br><br>of the Amazonian Basin; (iii) A medium-resolution grid covering Rondonia (iv) A<br><br>high-resolution grid centered around the highly-deforested part of Rondonia; and<br><br>(v) A very-high-resolution grid covering most of the LBA Mesoscale IFC site.<br><br>While convective cells will be more or less resolved in the very-high-resolution<br><br>grid which, therefore, will provide great details on precipitation and clouds in<br><br>the region of interest, the purpose of the low-resolution grid is to assimilate<br><br>large-scale observations (and, possibly, an analysis produced by either NCEP,<br><br>ECMWF, or INPE) of various meteorological conditions, and provide large-scale<br><br>forcing to the higher-resolution grids.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">The model so configured will be run at least for<br><br>the LBA-MIFC periods (January-February 1999 and June-July 2000). If computing<br><br>resources permit, the entire period between the two MIFCs will also be<br><br>simulated.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">To evaluate the ability of ClimRAMS to simulate<br><br>the hydrometeorology of this region, the results of this simulation will be<br><br>compared with observations, with a particular focus on clouds and surface energy<br><br>and water balance. Because the area scanned by the S-Pol radar will be<br><br>particularly rich in observations, the evaluation will concentrate on the<br><br>results produced in the very-high resolution grid.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">As part of this task, a sensitivity analysis of<br><br>the importance of assimilation frequency (spatial and temporal) of various<br><br>variables will be performed. Also, the importance of grid resolution will be<br><br>estimated, by eliminating progressively the higher resolution grids. This will<br><br>provide a crucial information for Task 3, in terms of the size of the domain<br><br>that we will be able to simulate at a high to very-high resolution, given<br><br>available computer resources.</font><br><br><p><font size="2"> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Task 2: Model Coupling (0.5 year)</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">The coupling approach to be used in this project<br><br>will rely on the fact that ClimRAMS is already equipped with a data assimilation<br><br>package. This package will also be tested as part of the evaluation procedure<br><br>described under Task 1. The output of the GISS-GCM (at the spatial and temporal<br><br>resolution that will be available when this task starts) will be assimilated in<br><br>ClimRAMS, thus providing the large-scale atmospheric background needed to<br><br>correctly calculate the hydrometeorological processes over the limited area<br><br>simulated at high resolution. The ClimRAMS output will be averaged over this<br><br>high-resolution domain and fed back into the GISS-GCM through the<br><br>parameterization of subgrid-scale fluxes, following a procedure suggested by<br><br>Avissar and Chen (1993). According to this approach, the divergence of the<br><br>subgrid-scale fluxes (assumed to be generated by microscale turbulence and<br><br>parameterized accordingly in all current GCMs) will be substituted with the<br><br>microscale and mesoscale fluxes calculated explicitly with ClimRAMS. While this<br><br>approach is not very sophisticated, except for a few adjustments that will need<br><br>to be made on some of the GCM parameterizations (e.g., radiation and land), it<br><br>requires only a modest effort to implement. At a later stage, we will consider<br><br>develop a more efficient model, which will utilize modern techniques that have<br><br>been developed to nest grids (as, for example, used in ClimRAMS).<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Task 3: Impacts of Deforestation on<br><br>hydrometeorology (1 year)</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">Under this last task, we propose to evaluate the<br><br>impact of land use / land cover change on diurnal-to-interannual<br><br>hydrometeorological prediction at various spatial scales (from Rondonia to the<br><br>entire Earth).</font><br><br><p><font size="2">For that purpose, we will produce at least two<br><br>ensembles of simulations with the nested models, each consisting of several<br><br>two-year simulations (i.e., realizations): (i) A reference-case ensemble, using<br><br>the current deforestation estimate as used in Task 1; and (ii) A test-case<br><br>ensemble, using the same version of the model (with the same initial conditions<br><br>and same forcing), but assuming no deforestation. If time and computer resources<br><br>permit, we will perform additional ensembles of simulations, assuming<br><br>deforestation increases of 25%, 50%, 75%, etc.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">Initial conditions, for all ensembles of<br><br>simulations, will be assessed from an ensemble of 17-year simulations<br><br>(1979-1996) produced with the GISS GCM Version SI95, using observed<br><br>monthly-averaged sea-surface temperatures. These simulations, as well as the<br><br>GISS GCM Version SI95, have been described in details in Hansen et al. (1997).<br><br>Forcing, which include sea-surface temperature, land cover types, and emission<br><br>of greenhouse gases, will be derived from monthly mean data sets, at the highest<br><br>spatial resolution that will be available when this task is initiated. These<br><br>forcing conditions are also available at GISS.</font><br><br><p><font size="2">The effects of land use / land cover change will<br><br>be assessed by calculating the differences in several climatological conditions<br><br>(including air temperature and precipitation) between the ensembles of<br><br>simulations, at different time scales (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and<br><br>interannual) and different space scales (Rondonia to entire Earth).<br><br><br> </font><br><br><p><font size="2"><b>Bibliography</b></font><br><br><p><font size="2">Avissar, R. and F.
