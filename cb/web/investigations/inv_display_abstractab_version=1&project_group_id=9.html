<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>Our objectives are to quantify and improve our understanding of the changes in C<br><br>storage, C exchange, and nutrient dynamics in response to human-induced environmental<br><br>change in Amazônia. We will address these goals using models of canopy gas-exchange and<br><br>ecosystem biogeochemistry. These models will allow us to use existing information and<br><br>information collected during the intensive field studies to generate regional<br><br>extrapolations, thus creating linkages in LBA between the specific point studies and the<br><br>remotely sensed data. </p><br><br><br><br><p>We will use a hierarchy of models to scale in space from point to region and in time<br><br>from hours to decades. </p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li>At the finest scale we will employ a process-based multi-layer canopy,<br><br>    soil-plant-atmosphere model (SPA) that predicts hourly gross photosynthesis and<br><br>    transpiration. This model is parameterized with fine-scale measurements of canopy<br><br>    structure and meteorology, and can be tested against independently collected tower eddy<br><br>    covariance flux measurements. We will also develop a transect version of the model to<br><br>    generate predictions of gas exchange along an aircraft flight path. The transect runs will<br><br>    necessarily be parameterized with less detailed data, and will allow us to investigate the<br><br>    effects of any simplifying assumptions on model efficacy. </li><br><br>  <li>At the next coarser scale, we will use a simpler, aggregated model of daily whole-canopy<br><br>    carbon © fixation and transpiration. This model is derived wholly from the process-based<br><br>    model, capturing its aggregated behavior, while operating with daily input and at<br><br>    significantly higher computing speeds. This aggregated model serves two purposes. Firstly,<br><br>    it can be employed within a gridded GIS database, so that we can derive regional estimates<br><br>    of C and energy fluxes under specified land-use and climate change scenarios. Secondly, it<br><br>    can be inserted into our ecosystem biogeochemistry model as a validated<br><br>    photosynthesis/transpiration component. </li><br><br>  <li>The third model, of ecosystem biogeochemistry (MBL-GEM), will be used to examine the<br><br>    coupling between nutrient dynamics and longer-term C storage and exchange. Our primary<br><br>    goal will be to test whether we can predict the long-term responses of biomass and soil<br><br>    organic matter to land-use change using chronosequence data for validation. This model<br><br>    will also be coupled with a GIS-database model to generate regional extrapolations. In<br><br>    this instance our predictions of regionally varying biomass and leaf area can be tested<br><br>    against remotely sensed data as a further test. </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p>The proposed work will represent a significant step toward an understanding of<br><br>Amazônia for three important reasons. Firstly, by identifying key functional differences<br><br>in canopy gas exchange characteristics our soil-plant-atmosphere model will help to<br><br>develop effective inter-site comparisons. Secondly, our models represent a logistically<br><br>effective means for generating linkages among components of LBA, particularly in terms of<br><br>linking the point measurements of towers with remotely-sensed regional data-sets. Our<br><br>aggregation protocols will help to generate coarser-scaled predictions, with more modest<br><br>data requirements, better suited for extrapolation. Thirdly, we will integrate the<br><br>understanding derived from tower-based flux measurements into our ecosystem biogeochemical<br><br>models. Understanding the linkages between C and nutrient cycles is crucial for developing<br><br>long-term predictions of the response of biomass and soil organic matter to land-use and<br><br>climate change. </p><br><br><br><br><p>We hope to work closely with those teams making eddy flux measurements, both from<br><br>towers and aircraft. We are also interested in collaborating with groups developing<br><br>regional data sets of land-cover, vegetation type and climate variables. We are searching<br><br>for a Brazilian or South American collaborator to work with us on model parameterization,<br><br>validation, analysis, and extrapolation. </p></span>
