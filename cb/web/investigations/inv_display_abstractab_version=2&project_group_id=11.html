<span class="default-style"></p><br><br><br><br>Biomass<br><br>and rates of disturbance are major factors in determining the net flux of carbon<br><br>between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, and neither of them is well<br><br>known for most of the earth's surface. Satellite<br><br>data over large areas are beginning to be used systematically to measure rates<br><br>of two of the most important types of disturbance, deforestation and<br><br>reforestation, but these are not the only types of disturbance that affect<br><br>carbon storage. Other examples<br><br>include selective logging and fire. Logging<br><br>and subsequent regrowth of forests have contributed more to the net flux of<br><br>carbon between the atmosphere and temperate zone and boreal forests in recent<br><br>decades than any other type of land use. In<br><br>the tropics logging is also becoming increasingly important. According to the FAO/UNEP assessment of tropical forests, about 25% of<br><br>total area of productive forests have been logged one or more times in the 60-80<br><br>years before 1980. The fraction must be considerably greater at present. Thus,<br><br>deforestation by itself accounts for only a portion of the emissions carbon from<br><br>land. Furthermore, as rates of deforestation become more accurately measured<br><br>with satellites, uncertainty in biomass will become the major factor accounting<br><br>for the remaining uncertainty in estimates of carbon flux. An approach is needed<br><br>for determining the biomass of terrestrial ecosystems.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>LBA Ecology offers an excellent opportunity to obtain spatially detailed<br><br>estimates of both disturbance and biomass for the same region and time. The work<br><br>described here will be of value to LBA Ecology in integrating ground<br><br>measurements of biomass and satellite-derived estimates of disturbance. The<br><br>spatial data on biomass will help quantify the emissions and sinks of carbon<br><br>from land management in Amazonia. They should also help interpret direct<br><br>measurements of CO2 flux at tower sites. That is, what portion of a<br><br>measured carbon sink can be explained by recovery from past disturbances, as<br><br>opposed to other environmental influences?<br><br><br><br><br><p>Project Goals</p><br><br>1. determination of the rate of carbon accumulation (ha-1) in<br><br>logged forests;<o:p><br><br> <br><br><p><br><br>2. determination of the rate, areal extent, and spatial distribution of<br><br>selective logging and fire in two regions within Amazonia;<o:p><br><br> </p><br><br><p><br><br>3. determination of the spatial distribution of forest biomass as a<br><br>result of selective logging and fire; and<o:p><br><br> </p><br><br><p><br><br>4. determination of the spatial distribution and the net flux of carbon<br><br>as a result of selective logging and fire.<o:p><br><br> </p><br><br><p><br><br>The<br><br>work consists of (1) ground studies<br><br>in areas selectively logged and burned, where rates of wood removal, mortality,<br><br>and rates of forest growth are measured; (2) satellite<br><br>data (Landsat TM) to determine the rates, areal extent, and spatial<br><br>distribution of logging and fire in two areas along the arc of deforestation in<br><br>Amazonia; and (3) modeling to<br><br>determine the spatial distribution (a) of biomass resulting from current and<br><br>past rates of logging and fire and (b) of the net carbon flux associated with<br><br>these processes of disturbance and subsequent recovery. The goal is to develop<br><br>an approach to measurement of disturbance robust enough for use throughout<br><br>Amazonia as extensive satellite data become available for the region.<o:p><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>Study sites</p><br><br><br><br>Fieldwork<br><br>measuring biomass and rates of growth following logging will be conducted at two<br><br>to three sites yet to be determined.<br><br><br><br><p>Remote sensing</p><br><br>First,<br><br>Landsat TM will be used in two to three regions to identify selectively logged<br><br>and burned areas through identification of logging scars (areas indicating<br><br>logging by roads in primary forest and "patios" or clearing for log<br><br>storage). Second, the spatial distribution of 2000 sawmills in Para and<br><br>elsewhere throughout Amazonia will be used to evaluate how readily selective<br><br>logging can be monitored remotely, how important selective logging is for<br><br>changes in forest biomass and carbon balance in the region, and the relationship<br><br>between logging and fire.<br><br><br><br><p>Modeling</p><br><br>Extensive<br><br>data on disturbance (hectares logged and burned) will be used in a model with<br><br>site-specific data (carbon/hectare) on rates of mortality, decay and regrowth to<br><br>calculate the releases and accumulations of carbon resulting from logging and<br><br>fire. The model is a cohort model that tracks the area, age, and biomass of<br><br>lands subjected to different kinds of disturbance. </span>
