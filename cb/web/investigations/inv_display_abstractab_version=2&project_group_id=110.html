<span class="default-style"><b><p> Objective</p><br><br></b><p>The objective of this pilot study is to quantify the mass (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O vapor) and energy exchange of a mature transitional tropical forest stand over portions of the wet and dry season and to determine the meteorological and seasonal controls on these mass and energy fluxes.  As a pilot study, our goal is to collect preliminary field data over a 6-month period that extends over portions of the wet and dry seasons.  Measurements were initiated on 17 August, 1999 and will be continued (at a minimum) until 2 February, 2000.  </p><br><br><b><p>Location and Description of the Study Site</p><br><br></b><p>The study area is located near the city of Sinop in NW Mato Grosso, Brazil (11°24.75'S: 55°19.50'W).  This region is located near the ecotone of two major ecosystem types of South America (wet evergreen rainforest and<br><br>cerrado), and thus, represents the mesic boundary of cerrado and the xeric boundary of the rainforest.  Vegetation consists of transitional broadleaf evergreen forest<br><br>(cerradão) with a canopy height of ca. 30 m.   The mean annual temperature near Sinop is 24.1°C, and rainfall is ca. 2 m/year with a 4-month dry season.  Soils near the study site are predominantly ultisols (Brazilian nomenclature: Podzolico vermelho-amarelo<br><br>distrofico).  </p><br><br><b><p>Eddy Covariance Measurements of Net CO<sub>2</sub>  Exchange</p><br><br></b><p>Net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, evapotranspiration (ET), and convective (sensible) heat flux (<i>H</i>) of the mature cerradão stand are currently measured using tower-based eddy covariance.  The<br><br>e<b>m</b>ddy covariance system consists of a 3-dimensional sonic anemometer-thermometer (Applied Technologies, Inc., K-probe) for measuring the mean and fluctuating quantities of wind speed (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>w</i> ) and temperature and an open-path infrared gas analyzer<br><br>(NOAA-ATDD) for measuring the mean and fluctuating quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O vapor.  The eddy covariance sensors are mounted at a height of 42 m above ground level, which corresponds to a height of ca. 12 m above the canopy.  Raw CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O vapor fluctuations are output as mean voltages and converted to densities by multiplying by the requisite calibration constants.  Net CO<sub>2</sub> flux, ET, and <i>H</i> are computed using NOAA-ATDD software following a coordinate rotation of the wind vectors, and fast response (10 Hz) fluxes are calculated and stored on a laptop computer as 30-minute averages using a 200 s running mean and digital recursive filtering technique.  Raw (10 Hz) data are also archived for spectral analysis to assess the frequency response of the sensors and the data acquisition system. </p><br><br><p>The relatively low mean wind speed of the Sinop area (1961-1994 average = 1.5 m/s) is likely to result in low turbulent transport and high atmospheric stability, which in turn, can cause CO<sub>2</sub> to be stored in the canopy.  Because canopy CO<sub>2</sub> storage can lead to errors in the measurement of surface-atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, canopy CO<sub>2</sub> storage (<i>ÆS</i>) is quantified by determining the rate of change of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air column between the ground surface and the eddy covariance sensors.  The vertical CO<sub>2</sub> concentration profile is measured every 30 seconds at 1, 4, 12, 20, and 28 m above ground level using a closed-path CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer (LI-6251).  Samples are drawn from each height using a diaphragm pump and plastic (3-5 mm diameter) tubing, and air samples are switched using a solenoid switching manifold system controlled by a datalogger (Campbell Scientific Inc., Model CR-10X).</p><br><br><p>Net ecosystem CO2 flux (Fc) is calculated as Fc = Fm + ÆS, where Fm is the net CO2 flux measured at the top of the tower and<br><br>ÆS is the CO2 storage in the canopy. Fm is measured from the eddy covariance array.<br><br>ÆS s calculated from measurements of the vertical CO2 concentration profile.  Measured fluxes are corrected for the simultaneous fluctuations in heat and H2O vapor. </p><br><br><p>The measurement system is powered using 12 V batteries charged by solar panels, with occasional use of a gasoline-powered generator to rapidly re-charge the battery bank.  </p><br><br> <sub> <sub> <sub> <sub> <sub><br><br><b><p>Micrometeorological Measurements</p><br><br></b></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub><p>Measurements of net radiation are made above the canopy using a ventilated net radiometer<br><br>(REBS, model Q*7.1).  Soil heat flux is measured using 2 heat flux plates installed at a depth of 0.03 m below the soil surface<br><br>(REBS, model HFT-3.1).  Above-canopy incident photosynthetic photon flux density<br><br>(PPFD) and solar radiation are measured using a quantum sensor (LI-COR, model LI-190SA) and a pyranometer (LI-200SA), respectively.  Air temperature and relative humidity are measured using above the canopy using a shielded combination thermistor and relative humidity sensor<br><br>(Vaisala, HMP45C).  We are currently planning to install ventilated wet- and dry-bulb psychrometers throughout the canopy (1, 4, 12, 20, and 28 m above ground level) to measure the vertical temperature and vapor pressure profile. Precipitation is measured above the canopy using a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge.  Micrometeorological data are averaged over 30-minute intervals from observations made every 1 s, and stored using a multiplexed datalogger (Campbell Scientific, model CR 21X).  </p><br><br><sub> <sub> <sub> <sub> <sub> <br><br><b><p>Data Analysis</p><br><br></b></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub><p>Although data reduction and analysis are ongoing, modeling and other statistical analyses will be conducted after completion of the field study (February-May 2000).  Regression-based, non-linear physiological models will be used to assess the effects of seasonality (rainfall) and meteorology (radiation, humidity, and temperature) on stand-scale physiology. </p><br><br><p>Last Updated: August 26, 1999</p></span>
