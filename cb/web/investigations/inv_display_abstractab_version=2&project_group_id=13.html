<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose studies in two theme areas of LBA Ecology: land<br><br>use and land cover change (LULCC), and Carbon Storage and Exchange. This will<br><br>involve examining the human and biophysical dimensions of land use and land<br><br>cover (LULC) in the Ecuadorian Amazon associated with high rates of spontaneous<br><br>colonization by agricultural settlers migrating into the region since the early<br><br>1970’s. A satellite time series from 1973 to 1999, along with GIS thematic<br><br>coverage of biophysical gradients and geographical accessibility, was linked to<br><br>data collected on the ground from a probability sample of geo-referenced farm<br><br>household plots and communities. Data were collected on the latter in 1999 for<br><br>the same settler plots originally surveyed in 1990 to measure LULC over time in<br><br>detail, and to study the relationships between LULC and population and<br><br>socioeconomic characteristics of settler households. Image processing to<br><br>characterize LULC and spatial analyses of landscape structure was used to assess<br><br>the rate and nature of LULC and to model the effects of LULC, secondary plant<br><br>succession, and land fragmentation on carbon budgets and assimilation rates for<br><br>landscape strata and the study area as a whole. Statistical models were used to<br><br>estimate the demographic, socioeconomic, biophysical, and geographic<br><br>determinants of LULC. Agricultural extensification and intensification have both<br><br>been observed and documented at the three spatial scales of the farm plot, the<br><br>sector or community of the plots, and the region as a whole.</p><br><br><p>The project was carried out in an area of the Amazon<br><br>headwaters, one characterized by extraordinary biodiversity, undergoing more<br><br>rapid colonization and deforestation than elsewhere in the Western Amazon due to<br><br>its being opened up by roads following the discovery of large oil deposits. A<br><br>scientifically representative sample of 420 settler household plots covered in<br><br>1990 was re-visited in 1999 to provide a unique assessment of changes in LULC<br><br>over time, including land extensification, land intensification (and<br><br>sustainability of agricultural technology), land abandonment, and secondary<br><br>succession, with implications for the carbon budget. <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-font-family:<br><br>"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;<br><br>mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Lessons learned about the process of LULC will<br><br>contribute to policies to promote more sustainable methods of land use and<br><br>therefore forest preservation</span></p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p>Richard Bilsborrow: LULC, survey design and data<br><br>    collection, statistical modeling, policy implications</li><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p>Stephen Walsh: LULC and carbon measurements, GIS<br><br>    imagery, change metric</li><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p>Francis Baquero and Carlos Mena: GPS measures for LULC,<br><br>    GIS imagery</li><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p>Laura Murphy: LULC, data collection design and<br><br>    cleaning, statistical estimation</li><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p>Stephen McGregor and Brian Frizzelle: GPS data<br><br>    collection for LULC, GIS imagery</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>Project Site</p><br><br><br><br><p>The central part of the three northern Ecuadorian Amazon<br><br>provinces of Sucumbios, Orellana and Napo, which is also the principal area of<br><br>oil discovery, road-building, and colonization by in-migrants.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Activities</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li><br><br>    <p>GIS: Acquire remote sensing images, historical and<br><br>    current base maps and maps of roads and towns and infrastructure (to the<br><br>    extent possible, such as for schools, health clinics, oil camps, sawmills,<br><br>    coffee roasters, etc.), hydrography, topography, aerial photography<br><br>    (available only for 1990).
