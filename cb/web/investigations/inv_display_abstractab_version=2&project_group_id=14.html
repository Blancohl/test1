<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>The proposed research will focus on land-cover change, its quantification and forcing<br><br>functions, and on natural forest dynamics in the State of Acre, Brazil. Acre is one of the<br><br>prime frontiers for evaluating current trends of deforestation and logging. This region<br><br>already has large-scale colonization projects, logging activities, and extensive cattle<br><br>ranching, and has a population growing at 3%/year, one of the highest rates in Amazonia.</p><br><br><br><br><p>In addition, the region has unique characteristics for comparative studies of<br><br>degradation with extensive areas of eutrophic soils intermingled with nutrient-poor<br><br>oxisols and ultisols. The area has some of the most innovative alternative land-uses in<br><br>Amazonia -1.4 million ha of extractive reserves - that maintain forest ecosystem function<br><br>and provide income to forest residents. Acre also has about half of the 18 million ha of<br><br>bamboo-dominated forests of western Amazonia. The expansion and contraction of these<br><br>low-biomass forests have strong implications for the carbon dynamics of the region.<br><br>Uncertainties in the rate of deforestation and in the biomass of primary forests currently<br><br>limit estimates of anthropogenic modifications of the Amazonian carbon budget. Rates of<br><br>deforestation based on similar data sets differed by a factor of 2 in Acre during the late<br><br>1980s and estimates of biomass for primary and secondary forests in Amazonia vary by 30%<br><br>or more. </p><br><br><br><br><p>We will use multi-temporal satellite imagery extensive and ground truthing to determine<br><br>the rates, patterns, and causes of land-cover change during the past decade, at various<br><br>scales, concentrating in eastern Acre, and will compare this with other sites on the<br><br>western LBA transect. Geo-referenced permanent plots in different forest types will be<br><br>used to determine forest biomass, growth and mortality rates, as well as serve as<br><br>calibration sites for new satellites. Fire frequency and distribution will be determined<br><br>with ground truthing to verify AVHRR hot pixel data. We plan to participate in parallel<br><br>studies at primary and secondary tower sites along the LBA western transect. In<br><br>collaboration with other researchers, we will analyze the fire susceptibility of different<br><br>forest types, including secondary forests. We will use high-resolution remote sensing to<br><br>map logging activities, natural clearings, and forest types. Multi-temporal imagery will<br><br>be used to estimate the dynamics of the bamboo-dominated forests in the region. </p><br><br><br><br><p>These detailed studies will be compared with the regional data produced by other<br><br>collaborators to estimate precision and accuracy of basin-wide deforestation and burning<br><br>rates. These data will be stratified as a function of land tenure (spontaneous and planned<br><br>settlements, ranching, logging and extractive reserves) and soil nutrient status. We will<br><br>evaluate the patterns of land-cover change, incorporating socio-economic and policy<br><br>modifications, such as the new zoning programs and reduction in legal area for<br><br>deforestation that may drastically alter future scenarios of land-use in the region. The<br><br>knowledge generated will be incorporated into the Zoning Program for the State of Acre and<br><br>the Ecosystem Management and Global Change Programs of the Federal University of Acre. </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <p><br><br><br>  This proposal seeks to address the following questions, derived from the LBA-ECO<br><br>  research announcement: </p><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <p>1. Given that estimates of state-level deforestation rates differ in some cases by a<br><br>    factor of two, how may we improve the accuracy of remote sensing estimates of<br><br>    deforestation and land-use at the local and regional scales such that the data are more<br><br>    useful both for modeling carbon fluxes and for land-use management? </p><br><br>    <p>2. The official data on logging and burning are frequently misleading. How can more<br><br>    dependable estimates of these activities be made? How can we differentiate the burning of<br><br>    felled forests, pastures and undergrowth in logged and primary forests? </p><br><br>    <p>3. Lateral migration of forest types with differing biomass, as well as in situ changes<br><br>    in mortality and growth, affect carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and the biosphere.<br><br>    How important are such migration and in situ changes for the carbon budget in western<br><br>    Amazonia? </p><br><br>    <p>4. How may the knowledge generated by this and other NASA research reach local and<br><br>    regional societies so as to promote the prospect of sustainable land-use? </p><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br>  <p>The following hypotheses form the core of the study effort: </p><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 1. Scale and classification factors seriously affect deforestation estimates.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 2. Small-scale deforestation and burning are poorly measured on annual basis.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 3. Hot pixels of NOAA/AVHRR imagery indicate fire frequency on a daily basis<br><br>        and distribution in western Amazonia.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 4. Coupling deforestation rates with forest types will substantially improve<br><br>        estimates of carbon fluxes in western Amazonia.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 5. The life cycles of bamboo-dominated forests affect the carbon budget of<br><br>        western Amazonia on a decade time-scale .</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 6. Carbon cycling of large trees in primary forests is spatially and<br><br>        temporally discontinuous. Forest C uptake is nearly uniform spatially and continuous in<br><br>        time, while release is discrete in time and space.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 7. Annual Landsat TM imagery improves estimates of logging activities in<br><br>        western Amazonia.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 8. Re-growing forests represent a minor sink of carbon in western Amazonia.</li><br><br>      <li>Hypothesis 9. Agroforestry systems in converted lands increase vegetative biomass and<br><br>        decrease fire frequency as compared to neighboring converted lands without agroforestry<br><br>        systems.</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Last Updated:</b> May 15, 1998<br><br><br> </p></span>
