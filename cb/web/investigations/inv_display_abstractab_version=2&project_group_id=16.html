<span class="default-style"><p><b>Objectives</b></p><br><br><br><br><p>We have proposed a low-cost effort, focused on LBA-ECO research agendas, that will<br><br>build upon our ongoing activities in land surface and ecosystem modeling. Our group is<br><br>currently funded as an EOS Interdisciplinary Science Team (IDS) by NASA's Mission to<br><br>Planet Earth.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Our group is currently engaged in an effort to develop an integrated dynamical<br><br>biosphere model -- the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS). Our modeling approach<br><br>reconciles the disparity of the existing land surface packages and terrestrial biosphere<br><br>models by representing a more complete hierarchy of ecosystem phenomena, including: </p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>land surface physics</b> (energy, water, and momentum exchange within the<br><br>    soil-vegetation-atmosphere system) </li><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>canopy gas exchange</b> (photosynthesis, respiration, and stomatal behavior) </li><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>plant phenology</b> (seasonal cycles of leaf development, leaf senescence, and plant<br><br>    activity) </li><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>whole-plant physiology</b> (allocation of carbon and nitrogen, plant growth, tissue<br><br>    turnover, and age-dependent changes) </li><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>vegetation dynamics</b> (recruitment, competition for resources, mortality,<br><br>    disturbances, and gap formation) </li><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>carbon and nitrogen cycling</b> (flow of carbon and nitrogen between the atmosphere,<br><br>    vegetation, litter, and soils). </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p>Initial versions of IBIS have been used to investigate global patterns of water<br><br>balance, carbon cycling, and vegetation cover, as well as the potential impact of<br><br>increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on the hydrology of the Amazon basin. We are<br><br>developing a more sophisticated version of IBIS for simulations of global biogeochemical<br><br>processes, vegetation dynamics, and terrestrial hydrology as part of our funded NASA EOS<br><br>Interdisciplinary Science Investigation.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Working with other LBA-ECO investigators, we hope to use our integrated terrestrial<br><br>biosphere model to evaluate changes in land surface processes, ecosystem dynamics, and<br><br>terrestrial carbon storage in response to land use activities in Amazonia.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>We anticipate that these efforts will proceed along four areas:</b> </p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>Develop an historical perspective of land cover change in Amazonia.</b> Using a<br><br>    combination of remote sensing products (i.e., Landsat and AVHRR data), long-term national<br><br>    inventory data, and other ancillary data, one can construct an empirically-based model of<br><br>    land use activity and land cover conversion for the Amazon basin.<br><br>  </li><br><br>  <p>We plan to work with LBA-ECO investigators in developing land use and land cover<br><br>  change scenarios for the Amazon region. In addition, a graduate student in our group,<br><br>  Navin Ramankutty, is currently building a land-use model for reconstructing global<br><br>  patterns of land use and land cover change during the last 100 years. This work could be<br><br>  extended, at little cost, to focus on the Amazon basin as well. </p><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>Use land use scenarios as a driver of the IBIS dynamic biosphere model. </b>Using our<br><br>    IBIS dynamic biosphere model, and land cover change scenarios, we can examine the dynamic<br><br>    processes occurring within terrestrial ecosystems that give rise to carbon sources and<br><br>    sinks. Using IBIS to simulate dynamic ecosystem processes will provide several advantages<br><br>    over other modeling approaches, because it simulates land surface processes, canopy<br><br>    physiology and gas exchanges, biogeochemical cycling, and vegetation dynamics in a single,<br><br>    physically-consistent modeling framework.<br><br>  </li><br><br>  <p>We plan to collaborate with LBA-ECO investigators to develop appropriate simulation<br><br>  experiments, and to coordinate data exchange and model intercomparison<br><br>  activities. </p><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>Validate model simulations against hierarchical of surface and remotely sensed<br><br>    observations.</b> Working with data generated by LBA projects, we will be able to compare<br><br>    our simulations of land surface processes and ecosystem dynamics against a full suite of<br><br>    observations. These observations include (we hope) streamflow data, tower flux data,<br><br>    isotope samples (i.e., <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O), and<br><br>    satellite measures (including data from Landsat, AVHRR, and MODIS). Our integrated<br><br>    biosphere modeling approach, unlike other modeling frameworks, will facilitate a more<br><br>    complete validation procedure by linking direct biophysical measures (e.g., canopy<br><br>    spectral reflectance, energy and water fluxes, and isotopic fractionation) and longer-term<br><br>    ecological, biogeochemical and hydrological measures (e.g., leaf area index, biomass, soil<br><br>    carbon, runoff and river discharge).<br><br><br> </li><br><br>  <b><br><br>  <li>Evaluate response of net carbon exchange to land use scenarios.</b> Finally, we will be<br><br>    able to examine how changes in land use (past, present, and future) may affect the gross<br><br>    carbon budget of the Amazonian region. </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p><br><br><br>To facilitate communication and collaboration with Brazilian scientists, we will<br><br>coordinate our efforts with Prof. Marcos Costa, who is currently working with Foley's<br><br>group at Wisconsin. Costa is a Professor in the Department of Agricultural Engineering at<br><br>the Federal University of Viçosa.<br><br><br> </p></span>
