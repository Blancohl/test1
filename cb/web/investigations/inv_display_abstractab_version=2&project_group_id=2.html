<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose studies in carbon storage and exchange. We propose to work in disturbed and<br><br>undisturbed sites along a C3/C4 gradient (savanna to rainforest). </p><br><br><br><br><p>Project Overview</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose to measure stable isotope ratio measurements of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>to infer changes in terrestrial ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration (sink or source<br><br>strength) on local and regional scales. These measurements will be made in conjunction<br><br>with soil respiration rates and collaborative studies with eddy flux tower studies. Within<br><br>terrestrial ecosystems, photosynthesis and respiration have different and contrasting<br><br>effects on the carbon and oxygen isotope ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Monitoring<br><br>shifts in both the concentration and stable isotope ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>can be used as a tool to study large scale terrestrial ecosystem gas exchange processes,<br><br>but the linkages of ecosystem and regional isotope ratio signals have not been attempted<br><br>in the past. Regional and global interpretation of the stable isotope signal recorded by<br><br>the atmosphere requires an understanding of fractionation processes that occur during<br><br>ecosystem gas exchange processes. While we have gained a mechanistic understanding of<br><br>leaf-level isotope effects during photosynthesis and respiration, we need to extend and<br><br>apply our knowledge of isotope effects to the ecosystem- and regional-level in order to<br><br>constrain models so that calculations of large scale ecosystem gas exchange processes can<br><br>be made with confidence.</p><br><br><br><br><p>We have developed a nested sampling scheme for measuring isotope effects associated<br><br>with photosynthesis and respiration at three spatial scales: (i) individual chamber at the<br><br>soil surface; (ii) canopy tower for canopy and/or ecosystem level; (iii) aircraft sampling<br><br>of changes in the convective boundary layer for the regional level. Our research plan will<br><br>allow us to determine the impacts of land-use changes (conversion of C3 forest to C4<br><br>pasture grasses) to regional productivity because the C3 and C4 plants have very different<br><br>isotope effects during photosynthesis. Interannual variability associated with El Niño/<br><br>La Niña events should also have substantial effects on the timing and magnitude of<br><br>ecosystem gas exchange processes and associated isotope effects. Direct measurements of<br><br>the effects of El Niño/ La Niña events on isotope effects during photosynthesis and<br><br>respiration are needed for future large scale isotope modeling studies. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Proposed Measurements</p><br><br><br><br><p>The proposed study will make several key LBA-ECO measurements at each of the three<br><br>primary regions along the east Amazônia transect between Brasília and Manaus, including:<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>soil respiration rates</li><br><br>      <li>carbon isotope ratio analyses of soil organic matter</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratio analyses of leaf material</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of CO<sub>2</sub> within the soil</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of CO<sub>2</sub> released from the soil surface</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of total ecosystem respiration</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of ecosystem photosynthetic discrimination</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of landscape-level respiration</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of landscape-level photosynthetic discrimination</li><br><br>      <li>carbon and oxygen isotope ratios and profiles of CO<sub>2</sub> within the convective<br><br>        boundary layer</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>The measurements are proposed to be collected 2-4 times per year, depending on<br><br>parameter complexity and other team-project considerations. Our studies will be conducted<br><br>in close association with simultaneous eddy covariance measurements, made by other<br><br>researchers, in order to obtain information about ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration<br><br>and turbulent exchange. The leaf- level, canopy- level, and regional-level models of<br><br>isotope fractionation can be used to determine the effect of different terrestrial<br><br>ecosystems on the carbon and oxygen isotope ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, because<br><br>of differences in photosynthetic pathway, ecosystem composition, and environmental<br><br>influences. The information gathered using our isotope studies would help in determining<br><br>the role of the Amazon Basin as a net sink or source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Preferred Sites</p><br><br><br><br><p>Our interest is in spanning from seasonally dry cerrado ecosystems (Brasília) to<br><br>seasonal rain forests (Pará) and through aseasonal rainforest ecosystems (Manaus).<br><br>Primary research sites in each of three major areas along this geographic transect will be<br><br>chosen in (a) primary rainforest or cerrado, (b) pastures derived from primary forest<br><br>conversion, and (c) secondary growth forest. This provides us with 9 different sites with<br><br>which to examine ecosystem and land-use changes (canopy and soil levels) and with 3<br><br>regions across Amazônia with which to examine landscape processes. Strong isotope ratio<br><br>gradients exist at each of the major sites that should allow us to differentiate carbon<br><br>turnover and respiration sources. Clear C3/C4 differences in species composition exist<br><br>between forest and pasture species along this entire gradient. Virtually all of the<br><br>pasture species (native and introduced) have C4 photosynthesis and all of the forest<br><br>species have C3 photosynthesis. A potentially strong C3 - C4 gradient exists as well in<br><br>the transition between tropical rainforest and cerrado ecosystems. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Education</p><br><br><br><br><p>This proposal provides a strong education component, which includes training Brazilian<br><br>graduate and postgraduate scientists. We plan to provide lecture/laboratory opportunities<br><br>for Brazilians to participate in the Utah Stable Isotope Ecology course, as well as<br><br>exploring development of a similar course in Brazil. There is also the opportunity for<br><br>other LBA investigators to receive stable isotope ratio training at SIRFER. </p><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Last Updated:</b> May 18, 1998 </p></span>
