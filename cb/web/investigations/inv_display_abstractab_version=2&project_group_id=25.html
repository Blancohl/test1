<span class="default-style"><p>Summary</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will integrate remote sensing, GIS and field sampling of soil and vegetation to<br><br>develop predictive models relating land cover change to its effect on nutrient cycling<br><br>along the environmental gradients proposed as LBA transects. We predict that differences<br><br>in substrate composition and environment will drive distinctly different rates of<br><br>regeneration and affect the duration of pasture use, thus requiring different approaches<br><br>for sustainable management. We will conduct time-series analysis of land-cover change<br><br>using Landsat MSS and TM combined with radar to enhance discrimination of pasture and<br><br>early stages of forest regeneration. Our initial focus will be in Rondonia and Marab√°,<br><br>where historical satellite data have been assembled and analyzed, and where a large body<br><br>of process level soils and vegetation data already exist. Site selection for soil<br><br>biogeochemical sampling will be driven by explicit, rule-driven mapping of terrain<br><br>attributes (initially from digitized topographic maps) and land-cover/land-use maps<br><br>derived from remote sensing. Soils and vegetation will be sampled for laboratory analysis<br><br>of cations, exchange properties, carbon, nitrogen, bulk density, wet chemical extraction<br><br>of P from different pools, and possibly <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr isotopic ratios<br><br>for nutrient provenance. We will develop mechanistic models that relate soil nutrient<br><br>composition and dynamics to soil. At each sampling locality the effect of land cover<br><br>conversion and subsequent management will be documented by analysis of N, P , mineral<br><br>composition and cation pools existing in soils on comparable landforms. Analyzed along the<br><br>transects, these data will allow development of a mass balance understanding of<br><br>weathering, mineral transformation and the nutrient supplying status of Amazon basin<br><br>ecosystems as affected by environment and substrate.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Our long-term objective is to develop empirical/predictive biogeochemical models with a<br><br>focus on nutrient dynamics linked to environmental gradients and land cover change. We<br><br>will predict and test our models using current/future remotely sensed data sets. These<br><br>models and observations will be critical to understanding ecosystem dynamics as influenced<br><br>by land-use decisions and should contribute to sustainable management practices in the<br><br>region. Our research will contribute directly to the larger LBA objectives and will be<br><br>informed by results from other team members. </p><br><br><br><br><p>General Strategy</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will be operating over a cascading hierarchy of scales. The broadest scale being the<br><br>Amazon basin which will be segmented by the LBA transect structure. The next scale will<br><br>focus on the region around the intensively studied tower sites, which we expect will be<br><br>underlain by a specific geologic formation. Within the intensive study sites we will<br><br>conduct further stratification by two methods. First, we will use digital topography data<br><br>to calculate terrain attributes that will allow us to segment the study sites into<br><br>landforms and landform elements that are grouped according to similar statistical and<br><br>physiographic properties. At the most detailed level of separation (in this case,<br><br>determined by data resolution), we will develop variograms to determine the spacing<br><br>required for collection of uncorrelated samples. We will then be able to collect random<br><br>samples at that level. This explicit, statistically based sampling scheme allow upward<br><br>scaling of results based on topography which is extremely important but we will have to<br><br>overcome data limitation problems through digitization of paper maps until topographic<br><br>data are generated by airborne campaigns or satellite. Second, we will develop land cover<br><br>maps and land use history maps using remote sensing data. Our remote sensing strategy is<br><br>to build on our preexisting experience mapping land-cover and land-cover change in Manaus<br><br>and Maraba to extend these capabilities to Rondonia and other regions along the transect.<br><br>We have already assembled all of the necessary optical data for Rondonia and some SIR-C<br><br>data. We will pursue additional radar data, such as JERS-1 data sets being assembled by<br><br>the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for much of the basin. We have already developed the<br><br>programs and obtained the computer facilities that will enable us to generate land-cover<br><br>and land-use histories rapidly in any region of the basin where data are available. Once<br><br>the topographic hierarchy and land cover/land use history maps are completed, we can<br><br>compare the two to determine the landscape pattern of land conversion and to ensure that<br><br>the sampling scheme adequately covers all land cover types.</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will focus detailed sampling on comparisons among primary forest and various land<br><br>cover classes. As other researchers have done, we expect to make intensive use of pasture<br><br>chronosequences, which will give us a time history of biogeochemical change. Finally, we<br><br>will compare biogeochemical behavior in and between different land cover types across the<br><br>LBA transects. We anticipate that as LBA our soil biogeochemistry data will be useful to<br><br>plant ecologists and other biogeochemists on the LBA Science Team and expect to adjust<br><br>sampling priorities to meet the overall needs of the LBA Team. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Remote Sensing Strategy</p><br><br><br><br><p>The remotely sensed methodologies we will employ build heavily off of seven years of<br><br>prior experience working in several areas within the Amazon basin. We will employ spectral<br><br>mixture models using reference end-members as described by Adams et al., (1993, 1995) and<br><br>Roberts et al., 1997a. Through past research in the area we have already developed a<br><br>spectral library that is applicable to much of the basin. Where new leaf level and canopy<br><br>level spectra become available they will be incorporated into our existing libraries.</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will use a binary decision tree approach to classify spectral mixture models from<br><br>Landsat TM and MSS into at least seven classes, including primary forest, second growth,<br><br>pasture, water, construction (roads/urban), recently burned, and cloud/smoke obscured. We<br><br>will employ multi-temporal techniques described by Roberts et al, (1997a) to subdivide<br><br>pasture and second growth forest into age classes to establish rates of pasture<br><br>maintenance and regeneration. Potential for regeneration and sustainable land use will<br><br>vary as some function of intensity of pasture use and age. Images will be screened for<br><br>clouds using techniques described by Roberts et al. (1997a). Classification errors can be<br><br>reduced through use of time series as well. Difficulties will occur in separating green<br><br>pastures and some types of agriculture from second growth forest. This problem is expected<br><br>to be particularly significant in Rondonia, which has extensive pastures, croplands and<br><br>some plantations. To facilitate mapping we will explore use of L band radar, using SIR-C<br><br>data where available (such as Rondonia) and JERS-1 in other regions.</p><br><br><br><br><p>If new remotely sensed optical and microwave data sets become available during the<br><br>course of LBA we will take advantage of them opportunistically. For example, we have<br><br>extensive experience in the analysis of AVIRIS data for mapping vegetation. We have<br><br>already obtained and analyzed some AVIRIS data collected in the state of Rondonia during<br><br>the SCAR-B program. If enhanced TM or LEWIS HSI data become available we will use them as<br><br>part of our strategy for testing predictions for regeneration success and explore their<br><br>capabilities for improvements in spectral libraries and vegetation classification. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Landscape Modeling, Site Selection, and Scaling of Results</p><br><br><br><br><p>A suite of Earth processes combine with land use to act as driving variables that<br><br>determine the present state of soil biogeochemistry in Amazon ecosystems. The importance<br><br>of individual controls is scale dependent. At the physiographic region level, gradients in<br><br>climate coupled with underlying geology drive the properties and processes of soils and<br><br>ecosystems. Rainfall may be seasonally limiting in parts of Amazonia; at the same time<br><br>nutrients may be conserved relative to the wetter regions. The nature of soil parent<br><br>material and the depth to fresh rock (containing nutrients) are significant determinants<br><br>of biogeochemical functioning. More locally where climate and geology are relatively<br><br>uniform, topographic variation controls soil biogeochemical functioning because of<br><br>redistribution of water and soluble nutrients along flow paths. Topography modifies Human<br><br>land use in predictable ways (i.e. certain landforms will be utilized more than others).<br><br>In this proposal we will quantify variations in soil biogeochemistry as affected by<br><br>natural and anthropogenic processes acting at these different scales.</p><br><br><br><br><p>The spatial distribution of soil properties (soil-landscape) is part of the overall<br><br>ecosystem and is a primary control on nutrient dynamics. A soil-landscape is a complex<br><br>geomorphologic, biogeochemical and hydrological system which controls the composition and<br><br>productivity of ecosystems and their response to disturbance. The characteristics of the<br><br>soil-landscape provide essential information for modeling the pools, pathways and fluxes<br><br>of water and nutrients. The key components for determining soil biogeochemical properties<br><br>are quantitative spatial models that include, but are not limited to soil properties such<br><br>as A-horizon depth, overall soil depth, clay content, cation exchange capacity, organic<br><br>matter content, available nutrients, nutrient supplying capacity and bulk density.<br><br>Topographic variation within the soil-landscape system modifies ecosystem functioning by<br><br>changing fluxes of water, energy and mass. Long-term differences in fluxes can be inferred<br><br>from differences in measured soil properties. The spatial distribution of soil properties<br><br>drive the location of monitoring sites for short-term ecosystem-specific fluxes within the<br><br>soil-landscape system such as water balance and nutrient availability.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Although it is difficult to measure below ground soil-landscape characteristics, we can<br><br>develop statistical relationships between soil properties and terrain attributes such as<br><br>slope, aspect, hill-slope position, and slope shape. Our approach, developed by Paul<br><br>Gessler and others (Gessler et al. 1995, McSweeney et al., 1994, Moore et al., 1993),<br><br>integrates a geographic information system (GIS), digital terrain modeling, and<br><br>statistical modeling to quantify relationships between soil properties and terrain<br><br>attributes, which are calculated from continuous digital elevation models using GIS map<br><br>algebra tools. Terrain attributes are inexpensive to map over large areas and<br><br>quantitatively describe the distribution of landscape processes (e.g. water flow<br><br>convergence/divergence, sediment and solute transport, solar radiation). The distributions<br><br>of terrain attributes can be used to design sampling schemes that capture the full range<br><br>of landscape variation and to predict soil biogeochemical characteristics. By then<br><br>sampling across the range of terrain attributes, we build statistical models relating<br><br>landscape structure to soil biogeochemical properties. These models allow explicit<br><br>aggregation of point measurement data or simulation model output (based on point source<br><br>input data) to landscape scales. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Implementation procedures in Amazonia are as follows: </p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li>Work in conjunction with the science team to identify priority physiographic provinces<br><br>    to cover a range of climate and substrate. We expect to start in Rondonia as part of the<br><br>    mesoscale catchment study and the first tower cluster along western transect </li><br><br>  <li>Develop digital elevation models from various sources: digitized 1:100,000 scale maps<br><br>    being competed by Tom Dunne's research team (we expect to digitize maps as well), new<br><br>    topographic mapping technology such as TOPSAR, Global Topographic Mapping Mission and<br><br>    laser altimetry, and semi-quantitative measures of topographic attributes using remote<br><br>    sensing data </li><br><br>  <li>Calculate (Moore et al., 1993) and map (Gessler et al., 1995) terrain attributes that<br><br>    are appropriate to particular landscapes (we expect to be hampered the lack of data at<br><br>    appropriate scales) </li><br><br>  <li>Use variogram analysis to determine minimum distances between sample sites required for<br><br>    random sampling of soil and biogeochemical properties </li><br><br>  <li>Overlay land use and land cover classes on the terrain attributes to determine<br><br>    preferential locations of land cover change </li><br><br>  <li>Modify topographically driven soil biogeochemistry sampling plan to ensure that all land<br><br>    cover types are represented. </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p>Soil Biogeochemical Sampling and Analysis</p><br><br><br><br><p>At each site we will characterize the weathering and nutrient status of soils by<br><br>sampling 3 detailed profiles further augmented by randomly distributed core samples to<br><br>document soil variability. Core sample site selection will be driven by the statistical<br><br>analysis of digital elevation models described above. Soil profiles will be described<br><br>according to USDA specifications (Soil Survey Staff, 1992). Channel samples of each<br><br>horizon will be taken for analysis of total elements, mineral composition, bulk density,<br><br>pH, exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, cations in soil solution, phosphorous,<br><br>carbon, and nitrogen.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Weathering and elemental losses from soils will be studied. Soil weathering leads to<br><br>significant leaching losses of the soil-derived nutrient elements (K, Ca, Mg, P), Si, and<br><br>even Al. It is critical to document the weathering state of the different substrates<br><br>because it is indicative of the nutrient reserve for the ecosystem. The amount of<br><br>elemental loss relative to the parent material provides a measure of the weathering state<br><br>of a soil profile and its present nutrient supplying capacity. Recent development of<br><br>physio-chemical strain gauge based on mass balance allows the use of accumulated strain to<br><br>calculate chemical gains and losses (Chadwick et al., 1990). An immobile element, i, (e.g.<br><br>Zr) is used to compute the change in volume during pedogenesis as follows: </p><br><br><br><br><p>         i,w = (pCi,p/wCi,w) - 1                   (1)       </p><br><br><br><br><p>Where is dry bulk density (g cm<sup>-3</sup>), C is element mass (wt. %), w is<br><br>weathered horizon, and p is parent material. Negative values represent collapse of the<br><br>profile. Once the bulk strain is computed, chemical mass gains and losses of a mobile<br><br>element, j, per unit volume of parent material, j,w (g cm<sup>-3</sup>) are calculated<br><br>with eq. 2: </p><br><br><br><br><p>         j,w = (wCj,w(i,w + 1) - pCj,p)/100.       (2)       </p><br><br><br><br><p>Elemental analyses will be made by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry on fused or<br><br>acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, & HF) dissolved soil material for<br><br>all major rock forming elements.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Nutrient and mineralogical distribution within soils. In addition to the total mass of<br><br>elements, selective wet chemical extractions are used to document the form that an element<br><br>is in: exchangeable, organically bound, bound in secondary minerals, bound in primary<br><br>minerals. Exchange bases are determined using NH<sub>4</sub>OAC extraction, exchange Al by<br><br>KCl extraction and exchange capacity by the sum of bases and Al (Soil Survey Staff, 1992).<br><br>Soil organic C and N will be determined using a Carlo Erba CNS analyzer; Standard<br><br>procedures will be used for bulk density and pH (Soil Survey Staff, 1992).</p><br><br><br><br><p>The quantity, chemical forms, and availability of soil phosphorus are particularly<br><br>important. The dominant forms of phosphorus vary systematically with soil mineralogical<br><br>and chemical properties (Walker and Syers, 1976; Cole and Heil, 1981; Schimel et al.,<br><br>1985; Smeck, 1985, Cross and Schlesinger, 1995). That variation often regulates carbon and<br><br>nitrogen dynamics in the long term. We propose to evaluate the forms of soil P using<br><br>Tiessen and Mohr's (1993) modification of the Hedley et al. (1982) sequential extraction<br><br>procedure. This procedure yields P fractions that are operationally defined, but<br><br>experience has shown that they correlate quite well with Walker and Syers (1976)<br><br>conceptually defined pools of P (Crews et al., 1995).</p><br><br><br><br><p>Mineral composition which controls cation exchange capacity and P sorption properties<br><br>will be determined using X-Ray Diffraction, and for selected samples, a series of<br><br>sequential extractions (Chadwick et al., 1990; Chadwick et al., 1994). For each of these<br><br>samples, gravimetric weight loss is measured after each treatment. Selective dissolution<br><br>procedures are as follows: </p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li>removal of organo-metal complex with peroxide (Wada, 1989) </li><br><br>  <li>removal of non-crystalline allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite using acid ammonium<br><br>    oxalate in the dark (McKeague and Day, 1966) </li><br><br>  <li>removal of crystalline goethite and hematite by Na-dithionite and Na-citrate using the<br><br>    Blakemore and others (1987) modification of Holmgren (1967) procedure </li><br><br>  <li>removal of the poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and gibbsite using (Jackson and<br><br>    others, 1986) </li><br><br>  <li>removal of kaolin by heating the residue to 500 ¬∞C followed by a 0.5 M NaOH extraction.<br><br>  </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p>¬†</p><br><br><br><br><p>Quantification of nutrient provenance is important to understand biogeochemical<br><br>dynamics. Strontium isotopes can be used to determine the provenance of calcium and<br><br>quantify the relative amounts contributed by silicate weathering and atmospheric dust and<br><br>rain (Capo et al., in press; Stewart et al., in press; Graustein, 1989). In order to<br><br>interpret <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr values, clear differences must exist between the<br><br><sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr values of soil parent material and atmospheric input. At<br><br>this time we do not know if we can apply the technique uniformly across Amazonia. As part<br><br>of this project we will collect preliminary samples for analysis and if warranted we will<br><br>propose a parallel study designed to identify the nature of nutrient recharge to the<br><br>Amazon ecosystems.</p><br><br><br><br><p><i>Plant and Litter Nutrients.</i> The nutrient status of plants and the distribution<br><br>of species in a landscape provide a natural measure of the nutrient supplying capability<br><br>of the soil where they are growing. The youngest fully-expanded stem of mature, sun leaves<br><br>will be analyzed for leaf mass per area, N, P, base cations, Fe and Al. We will measure N<br><br>mineralization using intact core incubations and N and P availability using resin bags. We<br><br>anticipate that leaves taken from trees growing on from nutrient rich soils will have<br><br>enhanced P concentrations compared with leaves from nutrient poor soils. This approach is<br><br>not without problems - element storage within vegetation and dilution of element<br><br>concentrations by growth as well as soil nutrient availability affect foliar<br><br>concentrations (Chapin et al., 1990).</p><br><br><br><br><p>The selection of measurements is based on data required to develop mechanistic models<br><br>of soil biogeochemical processes. We have over 20 years of experience interpreting the<br><br>processes that lead to measured properties. Although developing mechanistic models is our<br><br>major focus, a subset of these data can also be used as input to ecosystem simulation<br><br>models such as CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988). We can run CENTURY simulations to compare<br><br>with our mechanistic understanding and contribute the edaphic input parameters to other<br><br>members of the LBA Science Team. </p></span>
