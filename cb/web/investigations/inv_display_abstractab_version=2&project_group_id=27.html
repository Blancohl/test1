<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose studies on the effects of conversion from rainforest to pasture on the<br><br>biogeochemistry of small streams in the Amazon basin. Questions about how organic matter<br><br>and nutrients move from uplands to streams, how land use alters those inputs and controls,<br><br>and how terrestrially-controlled inputs are reflected in successively larger streams, are<br><br>central to our understanding of the ecological functioning and material fluxes in drainage<br><br>basin networks Our research will focus on three questions about how the dominant land use<br><br>conversion now occurring in the Amazon Basin-the conversion of moist tropical forest to<br><br>cattle pasture-changes the biogeochemistry and ecological functioning of small streams in<br><br>the Amazon Basin: </p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li><b>Question 1:</b> What is the role of uniform forest and pastureland use in the<br><br>    drainage basin in determining the biogeochemical composition of stream waters?</li><br><br>  <li><b>Question 2:</b> What is the effect on stream organic carbon production of altered<br><br>    nutrient inputs from the drainage basin?</li><br><br>  <li><b>Question 3:</b> Are patterns of nutrient concentrations, organic matter and control<br><br>    of organic matter production associated with forest or pasture land use identifiable and<br><br>    persistent in successively larger drainage basins?</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>We will measure stream chemistry in paired drainage basins with second order streams<br><br>and uniform land-use and in larger streams and rivers of mixed land-use. One drainage<br><br>basin in each pair will have land use exclusively of native forest, the other exclusively<br><br>of cattle pasture. Stream water measurements in paired basins will be made bi-weekly as a<br><br>minimum during two month-long field trips, one during the period of low flow and one<br><br>during the period of high flow. When possible, these periods will be supplemented with<br><br>collections during the wet-dry and dry-wet transitions. To characterize stream<br><br>biogeochemistry, we will measure pH, conductivity, NO<sub>3</sub>-, NH<sub>4</sub>+, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup>-<br><br>(as soluble reactive phosphate), dissolved organic N and P (DON, DOP), K+, Na+, Ca<sub>2</sub>+,<br><br>Mg<sub>2</sub>+, Al<sub>3</sub>+, Fe<sub>2</sub>+, Si, Sr, Cl- and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>-,<br><br>total suspended solids, suspended chlorophyll a, and the C, N and P content of suspended<br><br>solids. We will add to these measurements the concentrations of total DOC and in different<br><br>size fractions determined by ultrafiltration. We will also measure the (<sup>13</sup>C<br><br>value of the POC and the DOC in the different fractions. To provide more detailed<br><br>information on stream discharges and element concentrations over a range of discharges, we<br><br>will install recording stage and temperature/conductivity sensors and autosamplers. To<br><br>test whether P limits algal growth in the forest streams if light limitation in removed,<br><br>we are deploying nutrient bioassays. We will measure the concentrations of inorganic<br><br>nutrients, other anions and cations, DOC and the (13C value of DOC in a series of slightly<br><br>larger streams. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Contribution to LBA-ECO</p><br><br><br><br><p>This research program will contribute LBA Ecology an understanding of the ways in which<br><br>changes in land affect stream biogeochemistry and influence downstream transport of<br><br>materials. The work in small basins will develop a detailed picture of the characteristic<br><br>concentrations of nutrients, other ions, DOC and (13C of DOC and POC derived from uniform<br><br>land-use forest and pasture watersheds. The work in larger streams, including streams<br><br>formed by the confluence of the small streams in our uniform land use basins, will allow<br><br>us to trace the persistence of patterns present in the uniform-use watersheds in<br><br>successively larger drainage. We will also conduct bioassay experiments of N and P<br><br>limitation in these larger streams draining mixed land use. These experiments will tell us<br><br>how changing nutrient concentrations and nutrient ratios influence stream organic matter<br><br>production and how much land use change in a mixed land-use basin must take place before<br><br>patterns of stream primary production are altered. This project will integrate an<br><br>understanding of upland- small stream linkages into a landscape and drainage-basin network<br><br>perspective that takes into account the extent of forest conversion in different-sized<br><br>basins and how the biogeochemical changes resulting from that forest conversion are<br><br>transmitted downstream to the larger rivers of the Basin. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Linda Deegan: Algal bioassays & stream nutrient chemistry</li><br><br>  <li>Christopher Neill: Stream nutrient chemistry, soil chemistry and data-loggers for<br><br>    physical parameters.</li><br><br>  <li>Reynaldo Victoria: Concentration, size fractionation and <sup>d13</sup>C value of DOC.</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>Research Sites</p><br><br><br><br><p>We would like to continue our work at Fazenda Nova Vida and extend this work to the LBA<br><br>paired drainage basins. We have over 3 years of work on two paired drainage basins on<br><br>Fazenda Nova Vida, a 20,000-ha cattle ranch in central Rondônia. These basins contain<br><br>permanently flowing second-order streams and are matched closely in area and discharge.<br><br>The forested basins contain moist terra firme forest typical of Rondônia. They have soils<br><br>(Kandiudults and Paleudults) that are typical of large areas of the western Amazon Basin.<br><br>First and second order forest streams in the region are typically 1 to 4 m wide, with<br><br>clear water and sandy bottoms, and a pH of 5.5 to 6.8. Forest vegetation consists of open<br><br>perennially evergreen broadleaf trees with a high number of palms. Pastures have been<br><br>planted to grasses that are widespread in Amazonia, including colonião (Panicum maximum)<br><br>and several species of the genus Brachiaria. Soils are well-drained ultisols (red-yellow<br><br>podzolic latosols in the Brazilian classification). Clay content ranges from 10 to 40%.<br><br>Forest soil pH is ~5. We will also pursue the possibility of making many of the same kinds<br><br>of measurements in another pair of small basins of uniform land use that will be outfitted<br><br>for intensive hydrological studies (Martin Hodnett, Institute of Hydrology, Wallingford,<br><br>UK, personal communication). </p><br><br><br><br><p>Activities</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>We are assuming we can begin activities in mid-1998.</li><br><br>  <li>Stream chemistry and bioassays in paired basins - biweekly during one-month periods in<br><br>    the wet and dry seasons - June 1998 - Dec. 2000.</li><br><br>  <li>Stream bioassays for primary production nutrient limitation - June 1998 - Dec. 2000.</li><br><br>  <li>Stream chemistry in larger, mixed land-use streams - June 1998 - Dec. 2000.</li><br><br>  <li>DOC characterization in paired drainage basins and larger streams - June 1998 - Dec.<br><br>    2000.</li><br><br></ul></span>
