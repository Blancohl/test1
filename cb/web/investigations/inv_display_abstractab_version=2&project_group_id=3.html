<span class="default-style"><p>Motivation</p><br><br><br><br><p>We propose observations and analyses to infer transports of CO<sub>2</sub>, water<br><br>vapor, and energy from the natural and the disturbed rain forest by making direct and<br><br>inferential flux measurements. A major focus is to determine how Amazonian carbon exchange<br><br>is affected by natural and human-induced temporal and spatial variability in the<br><br>ecosystem. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li>To describe the radiation environment of the upper and lower canopy in natural and<br><br>    logged regions, to understand how the intensity and quality of incoming radiation are<br><br>    altered by cloudiness, and to determine what is the resulting effect on net ecosystem<br><br>    exchange of C (NEE). </li><br><br>  <li>To describe and model the mechanisms of turbulent canopy-atmosphere exchange in regions<br><br>    of closed-canopy primary forest, near natural gaps, and in the cut-over mosaic of a<br><br>    selectively </li><br><br>  <li>Logged site. </li><br><br>  <li>To relate canopy layer and boundary layer concentrations of potential temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>,<br><br>    and H<sub>2</sub>O, and use this information to estimate their partition into surface and<br><br>    canopy source components. </li><br><br>  <li>To determine what limits the accuracy of long-term tower flux observations of net<br><br>    ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the rain forest. </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p>Work Plan -- Detecting the Importance of Inhomogeneities on Observed Carbon Fluxes</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>To describe the ecosystem light environment, we plan to locate radiation booms on the 60<br><br>    m Rohn towers at the primary forest (PF) and selective logged (SL) sites. These booms are<br><br>    self-contained units that provide long-wave, short-wave, PAR, and net radiation in each<br><br>    vertical direction, and include an electronic level readout. A rotating shadowband<br><br>    radiometer in a clearing will measure diffuse and direct radiation components.</li><br><br>  <li>To make estimates of the respiration rate from tower CO<sub>2</sub> concentration<br><br>    observations, continuous acoustic wind profiler measurements will be maintained. By<br><br>    monitoring the backscatter signal, the thickness of the stable boundary layer will be<br><br>    obtained and the nocturnal surface flux (respiration rate) found by the layer budget<br><br>    approach.</li><br><br>  <li>To determine the importance of natural and artificial gaps on canopy venting,<br><br>    microclimatic studies using turbulence instrumentation and sub-canopy sounding balloons<br><br>    will be deployed at several sites during IFCUs. For selected periods, balloons will also<br><br>    carry small-diameter tubing that will sample the CO<sub>2</sub> profile in the gap, using<br><br>    a battery-operated pump connected to a CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer.</li><br><br>  <li>Sub-canopy flux measurements. The measurements, in conjunction with the profiles of T,<br><br>    q, and [CO<sub>2</sub>] proposed by Wofsy and Goulden, offer a unique opportunity to<br><br>    measure and then parameterize the mechanisms of mass exchange between the rain forest and<br><br>    the lower atmosphere.</li><br><br>  <li>Tower representativeness. We will apply and refine existing techniques to determine the<br><br>    source region for surface-based and canopy fluxes, using a vertical profile of turbulence<br><br>    intensity appropriate to the undisturbed and logged forest sites, respectively. We propose<br><br>    to operate a sonic anemometer at levels just above the canopy with the objective to<br><br>    determine at what times this level and tower top may lie in different turbulent<br><br>    microclimates.</li><br><br>  <li>To track cloud fraction and cloud base as 30 s intervals, a ceilometer will be deployed.</li><br><br>  <li>To determine cloud type and to make another estimate of cloud fraction, a digital sky<br><br>    camera will be operated for selected periods. In analysis we will seek to link these cloud<br><br>    characteristics from the surface observations to those from satellite images.</li><br><br>  <li>Two secondary tower sites, to be fitted with automatic weather stations that communicate<br><br>    to the PFsite by radio modem, will provide the minimal surface network for use with<br><br>    mesoscale modeling. This will also provide the framework to decide if there are systematic<br><br>    biases in climate observations from riverside stations.</li><br><br>  <li>Daytime mixed layer thickness will be found using established relationships between<br><br>    cloud base and mixing layer thickness, using the sounder and ceilometer data in tandem.</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>Training</p><br><br><br><br><p>We are prepared to give a training course in micrometeorological methods used in<br><br>ecological studies, to be held in and around Santarém. Since several of the ASRC team are<br><br>fluent in Portuguese, the material in these courses can be presented in that language or<br><br>in Spanish. In addition, transfer of the data acquisition system hardware and software to<br><br>local teams is planned. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>State University of New York</p><br><br></b><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>David Fitzjarrald: Design and deployment of the boundary layer sounding system for the<br><br>    respiration estimates; planning the flux measurement training program</li><br><br>  <li>Kathleen Moore: Primary responsibility for the field investigation of the forest gap<br><br>    microenvironment studies</li><br><br>  <li>John Sicker: Fabrication of mounting systems for tower-based radiation and turbulence<br><br>    instrumentation; electronic interfaces with other groups, cabling, in the design and<br><br>    maintenance of computer systems</li><br><br>  <li>Ricardo Sakai: Responsible for coordination of field operations in Brazil, assisting in<br><br>    the training program, designing data analysis strategy</li><br><br>  <li>Otavio Acevedo, Jeffrey Freedman, and Ralf Staebler (Ph.D. students): Upgrade to the<br><br>    group's digital sky camera, and the interface between ceilometer and the data acquisition<br><br>    system, and archiving data</li><br><br></ul><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, RS, Brazil</p><br><br></b><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Osvaldo Moraes: Analysis of turbulent spectra sub-canopy CO<sub>2</sub> transport<br><br>    models.
