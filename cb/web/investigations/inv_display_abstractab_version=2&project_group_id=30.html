<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <p>The proposed studies will focus on the effects of fire and land use change on the<br><br>  composition and persistence of litter and soil organic carbon and nitrogen and related<br><br>  changes in the soil-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide,<br><br>  and nitric oxide. The studies are proposed for a range of cerrado types and agroecosystems<br><br>  in the area surrounding Brasilia. We will quantify rates of carbon and nutrient cycling<br><br>  and characterize SOM at sites ranging from undisturbed cerrado to burned cerrado to<br><br>  agroecosystems. These experiments will include measurements of the carbon and nitrogen<br><br>  content and stable isotope ratios of the litter and SOM isolated by size and physical<br><br>  fractionation. The lignin content and concentrations of UV-absorbing compounds of the<br><br>  litter will also be measured. To determine the size and diversity of the soil microbial<br><br>  community at the sites, we will measure the amount and composition of biomarker compounds<br><br>  in the litter and SOM, particularly phosopholipid ester-linked fatty acids (PLFA) and<br><br>  ergosterol. For ecosystems that have undergone a vegetation change (e.g., from C<sub>3</sub><br><br>  dominated closed canopy cerrado to C<sub>4</sub> pasture) we will measure the carbon<br><br>  isotopic composition of individual PLFAs to indicate the source(s) of carbon being<br><br>  actively metabolized by the microbial community. To provide data and relationships needed<br><br>  for regional trace gas models, we will measure soil-atmosphere fluxes of trace carbon and<br><br>  nitrogen gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, N<sub>2</sub>O NO) under various natural (e.g. along<br><br>  transects) and manipulated conditions. Ancillary data relevant to these studies will also<br><br>  be obtained, including changes in soil temperature, moisture, and incident solar radiation<br><br>  that accompany land use change and subsequent agricultural uses of the cleared land.<br><br>  Limited manipulations will be conducted during the dry season at the cleared sites, e.g.<br><br>  pasture, to measure the effects of solar UV-B exclusion on fluxes of the trace gases from<br><br>  the surface litter and dead grasses. </p><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p><br></span>
