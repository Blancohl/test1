<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will study the rates and mechanisms of processes controlling carbon exchange and<br><br>trace gas fluxes at both old growth and selectively-logged forest sites in the Tapajós<br><br>National Forest and surrounding areas south of Santarém, Pará, Brazil. The work will<br><br>directly address two theme areas in LBA-ECO: Carbon Storage and Exchange, and Trace<br><br>Gas Fluxes. The proposed work can be divided into two primary objectives: </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <ul><br><br>      <li>Quantification of air exchange rates and gas fluxes between old growth and selectively<br><br>        logged forests and overlying atmosphere utilizing continuous, in situ radon-222<br><br>        measurements</li><br><br>      <li>Comparison of radon-derived exchange rate constants and fluxes with values derived from<br><br>        eddy correlation and flux chamber measurements by collaborating<br><br>        investigators.</li><br><br>    </ul><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><p>Radon-222 measurements in forest canopy air, the atmosphere immediately overlying the<br><br>canopy, the soil atmosphere and in flux chamber samples will be performed in direct<br><br>collaboration with long-term tower flux and microclimate observations as well as automatic<br><br>flux chamber studies of trace gas exchanges by other LBA investigators. The most critical<br><br>assumption in the use of long-term eddy covariance to determine ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>balance is that the measurements are not biased from day to night (Goulden et al. 1996).<br><br>Because net carbon uptake reflects the difference between two larger fluxes, respiratory<br><br>efflux at night and photosynthetic uptake during the day, a small selective<br><br>underestimation of flux at night can cause a large overestimation of long-term<br><br>accumulation. Our radon work will be focused on and fully integrated with related studies<br><br>at two flux tower sites along the east side of the LBA transect proposed to be established<br><br>by a team of investigators. One of the towers will be located in undisturbed, old growth<br><br>forest (Wofsy and others) and the other in an area where selective logging will be carried<br><br>out during 1998 and 1999 (Goulden and others). The radon measurements, conducted in<br><br>collaboration with tower studies of heat, momentum, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and<br><br>other gas transport by Wofsy et al., Goulden, Fitzjarrald and Moore, and others, and flux<br><br>chamber studies by Keller, Crill, Trumbore and others, will provide direct quantification<br><br>of the physical exchange of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and other<br><br>trace gases between soils, the forest canopy, and the overlying atmosphere in undisturbed<br><br>versus logged areas. The radon measurements will employ multiple flow-through detectors<br><br>whose use in continuous tower flux studies has been pioneered by our group. The<br><br>multiple-detector set has been successfully deployed in tower studies at remote locations<br><br>in collaboration with other investigators for continuous measurements every 30 minutes for<br><br>periods of up to 4.5 years and at altitudes above the ground ranging from less than 10 cm<br><br>to 496 m.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>The following scientific questions will be addressed through collaborative efforts with<br><br>other LBA investigators: What are the rates of gas exchange between forest canopy air and<br><br>the atmosphere and how do these rates vary on daily and longer term temporal scales? How<br><br>does vertical gas mixing vary with elevation within the forest canopy? How do episodic<br><br>events (e.g. gust fronts) affect exchange between the sub-canopy layer and the free<br><br>troposphere? How does thinning of forest canopy caused by selective logging change the gas<br><br>exchange rate with the atmosphere and the relative importance of various canopy air<br><br>ventilation mechanisms? Does canopy structure affect the rate of episodic flushing of the<br><br>sub-canopy atmosphere? </p><br><br><br><br><p>Canopy/Atmosphere Gas Exchange Processes</p><br><br><br><br><p>Recent eddy correlation studies of carbon exchange over tropical forests suggest that<br><br>mature tropical evergreen forests may indeed be a significant carbon sink (Grace et al.<br><br>1995. The most critical assumption in the use of long-term eddy covariance to determine<br><br>ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> balance is that the measurements are not biased from day to night<br><br>(Goulden et al. 1996). Because net carbon uptake reflects the difference between two<br><br>larger fluxes, respiratory efflux at night and photosynthetic uptake during the day, a<br><br>small selective underestimation of flux at night can cause a large overestimation of<br><br>long-term accumulation. Grace et al. (1995) reported an annual uptake of 1 tC ha-1 that<br><br>reflected the difference between ~10 tC ha-1 uptake during daytime and ~9 tC ha-1 loss at<br><br>night. It is troubling that Grace et al's (1995) site was a carbon sink on days with calm<br><br>nights but not on days with windy nights. Perhaps there is a systematic underestimation of<br><br>C loss during stable periods particularly at night. This is a methodological concern for<br><br>all tower-based carbon measurements.<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Because most trace gases emitted by the biosphere are either photo-chemically or<br><br>biologically reactive, they are potentially unsuitable direct tracers for trace gas<br><br>transport within, out of or into vegetated land surfaces. However, radon-222, a<br><br>radioactive natural gas, is ideally suited for studies of gas exchange in the tropical<br><br>forests of Amazônia for the following reasons: </p><br><br><br><br><blockquote><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <p>1. it is emitted almost exclusively from the soil</p><br><br>    <p>2. it is a chemically inert gas, making it suitable for tracing physical exchange<br><br>    between forests soils, canopies and the overlying atmosphere</p><br><br>    <p>3. the only sink for radon is radioactive decay which can be easily quantified using<br><br>    its known decay constant</p><br><br>    <p>4. its 3.8 day halflife yields nearly conservative behavior in studies of<br><br>    soil/atmosphere and canopy/atmosphere gas exchange </p><br><br>    <p>5. existing technology now allows for continuous, multi-altitude radon activity<br><br>    measurements both within and above the forest canopy. </p><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br>  <p>Trumbore et al. (1990; see equation 1) showed that radon-derived gas exchange rates<br><br>  compared favorably with estimates for CO<sub>2</sub> obtained by eddy correlation<br><br>  techniques (Fan et al., 1990; Fitzjarrald et al., 1990). Radon-222 was shown to have the<br><br>  potential to provide an independent and reliable measure of gas exchange rates between<br><br>  soils, forest canopy and the overlying atmosphere.<br><br>  </p><br><br>  <p>Our group pioneered the deployment of continuous tower-based atmospheric radon-222<br><br>  activity measurements during the 1988 ABLE 3A mission near Bethel, Alaska (Martens et al.,<br><br>  1992; Martens, unpublished data) and began continuous, multi-altitude measurements every<br><br>  30 minutes at a micrometeorological tower site as part of ABLE 3B in the open-canopy,<br><br>  boreal forests of northern Québec, during the summer of 1990 (Ussler et al., 1994). The<br><br>  rate of gas exchange can be computed using a simple inventory model:</p><br><br>  <blockquote><br><br>    <p><i>where h is the canopy height, C is the spatial mean trace gas concentration within the<br><br>    canopy, S is the soil flux, k is a canopy gas exchange coefficient, Ct is the<br><br>    concentration of the trace gas in the overlying atmosphere, and P and L are production and<br><br>    loss, respectively of trace gas within the canopy. In practice the term on the left is<br><br>    evaluated by comparing concentration profiles at successive time points.<br><br>    Evapotranspiration is not an important source of radon within the Amazônian or boreal<br><br>    forest canopy, and radioactive decay loss of radon is insignificant as well, so the<br><br>    integral term on the right side of equation 1 is negligible and can be eliminated.</i> </p><br><br>  </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Last Updated:</b> May 18, 1998</p></span>
