<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>There are few, if any, ecosystem simulation models that have been well validated for<br><br>scaling up trace gas fluxes across land use patterns in the tropics. The research we<br><br>propose for LBA-ECO is to test a series of fundamental process-level hypotheses<br><br>related to specific land use effects on ecosystem biogeochemistry and trace gas fluxes in<br><br>the Amazon region. The main tool we will use for these tests is the daily model version of<br><br>CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) developed at NASA Ames Research Center (Potter et<br><br>al., 1997), specifically for Amazon land cover/use types. The modeling tests will be<br><br>conducted in close collaboration with experimental field studies planned for the LBA<br><br>intensive research sites. Our ultimate research goal is to validate our model applications<br><br>for different land uses at LBA sites and to scale-up regionally and dynamically the<br><br>plant-soil biochemical, hydrologic, and production components of the daily NASA-CASA<br><br>Amazon version, so as to more closely simulate and predict the inter-annual ecosystem<br><br>observations from LBA. We propose to take a lead role for LBA-ECO in organizing<br><br>comparative modeling studies at LBA intensive study sites, and in developing methods to<br><br>couple ecosystem models of production and biogeochemistry to simulation models and<br><br>assessments of land cover change for the Amazon region.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Research at NASA Ames has been supported for the past two years to refine and<br><br>extrapolate the monthly and daily moisture balance and regional plant production<br><br>components of our CASA model version for Brazil, through a joint research grant (National<br><br>Science Foundation-TECO #9524050) with collaborators (D. Nepstad et al.) at Brazil's<br><br>Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazon (IPAM) to study moisture relations in forests of<br><br>the eastern Amazon. Regional model drivers have been assembled and an Amazon-basin version<br><br>(8-km spatial resolution) of the NASA-CASA model has been completed under this grant<br><br>(Potter et al., submitted). Under LBA-ECO, we now propose to investigate the effects<br><br>of changing land use in more detail, through relatively high resolution (<1 km2) model<br><br>applications that focus on ecosystem production, nutrient cycling, and biogenic trace<br><br>gases (BTG) exchange along important eco-climatic transects and at intensive LBA study<br><br>site locations. A central working hypothesis for our research is that the quality and<br><br>supply of decomposing plant material in soil is a major controller of mineralization rates<br><br>and trace gas flux during and after land use change. Interacting effects of soil moisture<br><br>holding capacity and canopy water relations must also be tested.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>As a second new component of the study, we propose to develop and test methods of<br><br>scaling up our various cover-type versions of the model to produce regional flux estimates<br><br>(at 1-km to 8-km grid cell resolution) primarily of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O (and<br><br>secondarily of NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOC)) for<br><br>comparison (validation) with aircraft and tower eddy flux estimates and for input to<br><br>transport tracer models of the region. Our fundamental working hypothesis is that<br><br>large-scale conversion from primary forest to pasture and recovering forests represents a<br><br>substantial and sustained change in the basin-wide emission budgets for trace gases. To<br><br>address the LBA priority of scaling up flux estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<br><br>(plus NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, and isoprene gases), we will conduct spatial model studies<br><br>chiefly for upland hydrologic environments. This will require continuous validation of the<br><br>model structure to represent major changes in soil moisture status, canopy cover, and<br><br>carbon/nutrient content of vegetation and soil with altered land cover/use, including<br><br>forest conversion to pasture, selective logging and secondary forest re-growth. We will<br><br>test land use effects on BTG flues from soils, nutrient mineralization from litter and<br><br>soil organic matter, nitrification rates, and plant nutrient recycling, with increasing<br><br>emphasis on phosphorus cycling in degraded areas and feedback to ecosystem production. As<br><br>we move closer to full regional scaling of simulations in the various land cover type, our<br><br>focus will be on testing model refinements related to broad scale drivers for rainfall,<br><br>cloud cover, vegetation types, inundation, and other soil attributes for simulations that<br><br>include the most current and detailed LBA results for land cover/use change in the Amazon.<br><br><br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Our modeling research results will identify which factors (ecological and<br><br>anthropogenic) significantly influence key processes that control productivity and<br><br>biogeochemistry of tropical ecosystems, and have important sources of variability in the<br><br>spatial or temporal domains of interest in the LBA. Over the course of the project, we<br><br>will deliver to LBA's data information system (DIS) the research products from our Amazon<br><br>geographic information system (GIS) analysis, including evaluations of BTG fluxes,<br><br>evapotranspiration, soil C and N stocks, and mineralization fluxes at a grid resolution of<br><br>1-km to 8-km for the entire Brazilian Amazon basin. In addition, we present plans to<br><br>enhance our ongoing cooperative training component in ecosystem modeling for counterpart<br><br>scientists and students from Brazil. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Principal Investigator:</b><br><br><br>Christopher Potter -- Overall model development and coordination</p><br><br><b><br><br><br><br><p>Brazilian Collaborator:</b><br><br><br>Claudio J.
