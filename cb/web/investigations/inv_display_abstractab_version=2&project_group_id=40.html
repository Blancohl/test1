<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>The objectives of this project are to measure changes in key soil processes and<br><br>the fluxes of CO2, N2O, and NO associated with the conversion of tropical rainforest to<br><br>pasture in Rondônia. In sum, these measurements are intended to provide a comprehensive<br><br>quantitative picture of the nature of surface soil element stocks, C and nutrient<br><br>dynamics, and trace gas fluxes between soils and the atmosphere during the entire sequence<br><br>of land-use change from the initial cutting and burning of native forest, through planting<br><br>and establishment of pasture grass and ending with very old continuously-pastured land.<br><br>These results will also be used to develop process-based trace gas models.</p><br><br><br><br><p>This research is organized around three questions:</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Question 1: How does the conversion of forest to pasture<br><br>    affect soil physical and chemical properties, C, N and P stocks, and C and N cycling<br><br>    rates?</li><br><br></ul><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Question 2: How does the conversion of forest to pasture<br><br>    affect the fluxes of CO2, N2O and NO between the soil and the<br><br>    atmosphere, and what are the major controls of these fluxes?</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Question 3: What is the importance of land-use change to<br><br>    trace gas fluxes on the scale of Rondônia and of the entire Brazilian Amazon Basin?</li><br><br></ul><br><br><br><br><p>We have examined changes in the stocks of C, N and P and the cycling rates of C<br><br>and N in pastures three years old and older at Nova Vida. While this work documents<br><br>changes to biogeochemical processes over a wide range of pasture ages, it does not capture<br><br>the potentially large and important changes that occur in the early stages of forest<br><br>clearing and pasture establishment. To understand the dynamics of biogeochemical cycles<br><br>immediately after deforestation, our efforts related to this question will focus on the<br><br>study of changes in C, N and P stocks and C and N cycling rates in a newly created pasture<br><br>at Fazenda Nova Vida.</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will also measure the fluxes of N2O and NO in the forests and in the<br><br>established pastures along our existing sequences. Concurrent measurements of N2O, NO and<br><br>controlling factors will enable as to predict the ratios of the production of these<br><br>important gases under a variety of environmental conditions. We will also perform<br><br>plot-level manipulations in a forest and two pastures to examine controls on trace gas<br><br>fluxes. We will manipulate soil moisture and fertilize with N and P in a forest site and<br><br>pastures cleared in 1987 and 1972. These manipulations designed to study the degree to<br><br>which soil moisture and N and P availability control the fluxes of N2O and NO. The<br><br>understanding of controls of trace gas fluxes gained from these experiments will be used<br><br>by us to construct predictive models that will allow extrapolation to other soil types,<br><br>climate regimes and management regimes.</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will use ecosystem models of biogeochemical processes coupled with geographically<br><br>referenced information on land-cover and land-use change to estimate the changes in C and<br><br>N stocks and the fluxes of CO2, N2O and NO throughout the Brazilian Amazon for the past<br><br>two decades. Extant biogeochemistry models will be parameterized by us using results of<br><br>our own work in Brazil and the research of others working in Brazil and throughout the<br><br>new-world tropics. The biogeochemistry models will be of two types: response function<br><br>models such as MBL/TCM and processes-based models such as DNDC. We will then couple these<br><br>models with information organized in our geographic information system (GIS) on soils,<br><br>climate and ecosystem state (land cover and land use) to estimate gas fluxes.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Contribution to LBA-ECO</p><br><br><br><br><p>This study will contribute in several ways to ongoing interdisciplinary efforts<br><br>to understand the current biogeochemical functioning of Amazonia, the influence of the<br><br>dominant land-use change on that functioning and how these changes will ultimately<br><br>influence the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and<br><br>climate. First, information derived from field measurements of soil carbon balance and the<br><br>fluxes of greenhouse gases (N2O, CO2) following deforestation will provide an invaluable<br><br>empirical base from which to build Basin-wide assessments of changes to carbon stocks and<br><br>trace gas emissions through the use of GIS and other tools for regional extrapolation.<br><br>Second, new information on NO fluxes will contribute to understanding of the current<br><br>contribution of intact Amazonian forest to the regulation of atmospheric oxidant balance<br><br>and its potential for alteration following land cover conversion. Third, improved<br><br>understanding of nutrient and moisture controls on soil trace gas fluxes will permit<br><br>construction of process-based models that will improve the ability to predict future<br><br>consequences of land-use changes, land management practices and altered climate. Not only<br><br>will we contribute information to LBA but also measurements made by others in LBA will<br><br>serve as a check on our scaling attempts</p><br><br><br><br><p>Research Team Responsibilities</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>Paul A.
