<p class="default-style"><strong>The Present and Future Effects of Ground Fires on Forest Carbon Stocks, Metabolism, Hydrology, and Economic Value in Amazonia and Cerrado</strong></p>

<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives<br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Amazônian forests are burning beneath the canopy. Each year, accidental ground fires<br><br>burn a forest area that is similar in size to the area that is cleared and burned, with<br><br>large but poorly understood impacts on carbon stocks, forest metabolism, forest hydrology<br><br>and the prospect of sustainable forest management. But these ground fires are not included<br><br>in deforestation estimates. Forest fires have the potential to initiate a positive<br><br>feedback with local climate, because fire induced reductions in forest evapotranspiration<br><br>may cause declines in local rainfall, provoking additional burning of forests which are,<br><br>themselves, more susceptible to fire each time they burn. These fires may be the first<br><br>step in a process of "savannization", in which recurrent burning favors the<br><br>replacement of fire-sensitive trees by fire-resistant grasses and thick-barked trees, a<br><br>process that has already transformed much of the woodland forests of the Brazilian<br><br>Cerrado, adjacent to Amazônia, into grass-dominated savannas.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>In the proposed research, we will contribute to the land-use, carbon stocks and surface<br><br>water chemistry themes of the LBA-ECO campaign by investigating forest fire. We will<br><br>estimate the contribution of anthropogenic forest fires in Amazônia and the Cerrado to<br><br>fluxes of carbon and water, and to the economic value of these forests, through a<br><br>combination of field experiments and measurements, landholder surveys, and regional<br><br>modeling. The proposed research will provide several data sets for the broader LBA<br><br>campaign. We will use eddy correlation towers to measure net ecosystem fluxes of carbon<br><br>and water vapor in four Cerrado woodlands with different levels of fire frequency. We will<br><br>measure the soil water balance to 8 m depth at these Cerrado sites, in two mature forests<br><br>and one logged forest equipped with towers in Amazônia, and in one logged forest that is<br><br>experimentally burned. These measurements will allow us to determine the soil layers from<br><br>which water is being extracted to supply evapotranspiration and to provide an independent<br><br>estimate of evapotranspiration that will permit interpretation and testing of the<br><br>tower-based estimates of ET. We will also quantify several components of net primary<br><br>productivity that must be measured to interpret tower-based measurements of net ecosystem<br><br>productivity, including fine and coarse root biomass (to 8 meters depth), fine and coarse<br><br>litterfall, and stemwood increment. Our study will provide land-use history maps for 300<br><br>geo-referenced Amazônian properties, stratified by property size and region, including<br><br>the timing of forest clearing, forest logging, forest burning, and agricultural management<br><br>practices, and the economic costs and benefits of fire prevention and fire control<br><br>practices. Finally, we will develop a mechanistic, predictive model that will allow us to<br><br>estimate the area of Amazônian forest that burns each year, and associated changes in<br><br>carbon stocks and water flux. This model will allow us to begin to examine the impacts of<br><br>climate change and land-use policy change on forest fire. Hence, the proposed study has<br><br>the potential to contribute directly to the LBA goal of promoting sustainable land-use<br><br>practices. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Summary of Measurements</p><br><br><br><br><ul><br><br>  <li>NEP, ET: Cerrado sites (Aguas Emendadas, IBCE reserve)</li><br><br>  <li>Litterfall, root biomass, AG biomass, deep soil moisture (ET, drainage): Tapaj6ós,<br><br>    Cerrado Sites, Sao Gabriel de Cachoeira (?), (and, through other projects: Caxiuaña, Rio<br><br>    Branco, Paragominas)</li><br><br>  <li>Flammability: Tapajós, (and, through other projects, Paragominas, Santana de Araguaia,<br><br>    Rio Branco)</li><br><br>  <li>Property surveys of fire history, economic aspects of fire prevention and fire damage:<br><br>    five study regions (Tailândia (e.
