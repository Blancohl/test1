<span class="default-style"><p>Objectives</p><br><br><br><br><p>We will combine radiocarbon with more traditional measures of C inventory and fluxes to<br><br>study the stocks, allocation and turnover of carbon at intensive study sites along the<br><br>eastern LBA transect. In spite of their importance to regional and global C budgets, the<br><br>understanding of C residence times in vegetation, detritus and soils is very poor in<br><br>tropical ecosystems. In particular, the roles of woody biomass and detritus, which contain<br><br>large amounts of C with decadal or longer turnover times, need to be better quantified and<br><br>are amenable to study with radiocarbon. We will focus on 5 specific components of<br><br>stand-level C cycling at several intensive study sites: </p><br><br><br><br><ol><br><br>  <li>quantifying of C uptake rates in growing trees using bomb radiocarbon in concert with<br><br>    diameter increment measurements to determine the average rate (and variability) of tree<br><br>    growth over the past 3 decades </li><br><br>  <li>determining age demographics of tree populations, using radiocarbon to determine tree<br><br>    age </li><br><br>  <li>assessing the rate of production and decomposition of dead wood debris using permanent<br><br>    plot and decomposition rate experiments </li><br><br>  <li>using radiocarbon in fractionated organic matter together with measures of C fluxes and<br><br>    stocks in soils to determine the amount and turnover time of C in fast-cycling and<br><br>    mineral-stabilized organic matter in soils </li><br><br>  <li>Using <sup>14</sup>C measurements in respired CO<sub>2</sub>, microbial biomass, and<br><br>    soil organic matter to partition total soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux into components from<br><br>    metabolic respiration and heterotrophic decomposition. </li><br><br></ol><br><br><br><br><p>We will combine these with measurements of litterfall, root dynamics and CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>fluxes by other groups to produce site-specific models of C cycling for comparison with<br><br>eddy correlation measurements of net ecosystem production (NEP).<br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><p>Our data will provide process-level understanding needed to apportion eddy correlation<br><br>measurements of whole-canopy net CO<sub>2</sub> flux into above- and below- ground<br><br>components and to predict what factors may cause inter-annual variability in net C<br><br>balance. Our studies of tree age demographics will scale this understanding to larger<br><br>areas, and help determine the best way to extrapolate NEP measurements in space and in<br><br>time. At the global scale, our measurements of the time lag between C uptake by<br><br>photosynthesis and loss by decomposition are needed to test ecosystem C models.<br><br>Additionally, our work with tree demographics will have implications for forestry<br><br>management, since our preliminary results show some large, economically valuable trees are<br><br>very old (1000 years). </p></span>
