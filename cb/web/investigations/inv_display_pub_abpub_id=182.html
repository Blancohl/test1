<p class="pageheader"><strong>Remote sensing and GIS at farm property level: Demography and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">Analysis of remotely sensed data at the level of individual farm properties provides additional insights to those derived from a landscape approach. Property-level analysis was carried out by overlaying a property boundary grid in a GIS. Data were derived from aerial photographs for 1970 and 1978 and Landsat Thematic Mapper images for 1985, 1988, and 1991. The study area contains approximately 3,800 properties, but this paper is based on a subset of 398 properties in the Brazilian Amazon. Analysis at the property level found patterns of land-cover classes that reflect differences in farming strategies of households. Data analysis at the household level was useful in explaining apparent mature forest to advanced secondary succession degradation in three years, not readily apparent from landscape analysis of remotely sensed data. The change was due to property-specific selective logging and the spread of fire from pastures into the adjacent forest</p>
