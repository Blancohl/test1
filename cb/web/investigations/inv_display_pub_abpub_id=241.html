<p class="default-style">In this paper, a methodology, example and accuracy assessment are given for a continental-scale mosaic of the Amazon River basin at 100 m resolution using the JERS-1 satellite, This unprecedented resource of L-band SAR data collected by JERS-1 during the low-flood season of the river amounts to a collection of 57 orbits of the satellite and a total of some 1500 1 k x 1 kB images, Interscene overlap both in the along- track and cross-track directions allows common reference points to be used to correct individual scene geolocation inaccuracies that have been derived from the satellite ephemeris, The set of common reference points is assembled into a matrix formulation that is used to solve for individual scene geometric offsets. By correcting for these offsets, each scene is placed within a global coordinate system, which can then be used as the basis for creating a final, visually seamless mosaic. The methodology employed in this approach allows for a mathematical foundation to be applied to the mosaicking process as well as providing a unique, traceable solution for correctly geolocating satellite imagery</p>
