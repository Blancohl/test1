<p class="pageheader"><strong>Relationships among soil fertility dynamics and remotely sensed measures across pasture chronosequences in Rondonia, Brazil</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">This study analyzed the relationships between soil fertility and remotely sensed measures over three pasture chronosequence sites in the state of Rondonia, in the western Brazilian Amazon region. Remotely sensed measures included shade, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green vegetation (GV) and soil (derived from spectral mixture analysis), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These were correlated against soil fertility parameters such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and base saturation. In temporal analysis, it was observed that NPV dominated the spectral responses of pasture canopies and tended to increase with pasture age as well. The increase of NPV appeared to be related to the decline of soil fertility, but soil texture variation also played a role. In the correlation analysis, soil P, known as the most limiting nutrient for pasture productivity, showed the highest correlation with remotely sensed measures, followed by soil K and base saturation. However, this result was not observed at the sites where nutrient availability was very low. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved</p>
