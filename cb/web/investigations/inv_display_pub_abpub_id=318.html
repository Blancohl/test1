<p class="pageheader"><strong>Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and Pb-210-derived burial rates in sediments of an Amazon floodplain lake</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">The C, N and P content of surficial sediments, Pb-210-derived accumulation rates, and burial rates of C, N and P were determined in Lake Calado, a dendritic lake located on the floodplain of the central Amazon basin. A significant positive, linear relationship was found between distance from the river and C, N and P content of the sediments (r(2) = 0.93, r(2) = 0.92, p <0.001 for C and N, respectively, and r(2) = 0.64, p <0.05 for P), indicative of high organic matter content on the floodplain and a greater proportion of clay near the river. Average sediment accumulation rates derived from two cores collected from each of three stations ranged from 41 to 117 mg cm(-2) yr(-1). Lake-wide, annual burial rates are estimated to be 3.5 mol cm(-2), 0.28 mol N m(-2) and 0.016 mol P m(-2)</p>
