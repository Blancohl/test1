<p class="pageheader"><strong>The Large-Scale Biosphere-atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA): Insights and future research needs</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">This overview summarizes general Large-Scale Atmosphere-Biosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) papers and highlights some of the insights gained from these investigations and needs for future research. It complements the overview of Silva Dias et al. [2002a], which summarizes the papers published on the joint major atmospheric mesoscale campaign in the wet season (WetAMC), which was held jointly in Rondonia with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) validation campaign known as TRMM-LBA. It also complements the overview of Andreae et al. [2002], which summarizes the papers describing the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, water, energy, aerosols, and trace gases resulting from the European Studies on Trace Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry, known as LBA-EUSTACH Project. The 17 papers summarized under this part of the special issue are regrouped into three main categories: (1) measurements and data sets, (2) remote sensing, and (3) modeling</p>
