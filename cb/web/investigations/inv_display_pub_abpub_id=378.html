<p class="pageheader"><strong>Scales of response of the convective boundary layer to land-surface heterogeneity</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">The convective boundary layer (CBL) over domains with meso-gamma-scale (2-20 km) heterogeneity is characterized by preferentially located, organized rolls of characteristic size equivalent to the length-scale of the heterogeneity. Additionally, random turbulent thermals also develop when the length-scale of the heterogeneity exceeds 5-10 km. This is due to a complex interaction between the horizontal pressure gradient generated by the heterogeneity and the buoyancy forcing. Consequently, the corresponding wavelet spectrum exhibits two peaks - one representing the turbulent thermals at a characteristic scale of about 1.5 times the CBL height and another denoting the organized eddies at a scale similar: to that of the heterogeneity. This implies that subgrid-scale parameterizations in models with grid size larger than 5-10 km, which account only for random turbulence, are inadequate for heterogeneous domains. Also, this study may provide a more objective classification of scales of atmospheric processes</p>
