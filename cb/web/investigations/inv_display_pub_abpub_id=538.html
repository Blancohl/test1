<p class="pageheader"><strong>Assessing the utility of spectral band operators to reduce the influence of total suspended solids on the relationship between chlorophyll concentration and the bidirectional reflectance factor in Amazon waters</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">Measurements of reflectance spectra, total suspended solids (TSS), chlorophyll a+phaeophytin (CLH) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plus pH, Secchi disk transparency and water depth were made in lakes associated with the Amazons and Negro rivers upstream from Manaus. Reflectance spectra were acquired between 400 and 900 nm using a spectroradiometer with a nominal resolution of 3 nm. Two spectral band operators designed to detect the CHL signal in waters with high TSS concentrations were examined with the aid of linear and nonlinear regression methods. Results showed that none of the proposed operators were successful in Amazon white water systems</p>
