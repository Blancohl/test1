<p class="pageheader"><strong>Amazonian climate: results and future research</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">Some of the results from the climate component of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA), which are presented in this Special Issue are summarised. Recent advances in Amazonian climate modelling are also discussed. There is a range of papers which fall into three groups: surface fluxes and boundary layer growth; convection, clouds and rainfall; and climate modelling. The new insight given by this work is discussed and an argument is made for future research to employ a wider approach to Amazonian climate modelling</p>
