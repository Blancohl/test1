<p class="default-style">ABSTRACT :RAINFALL VARIABILITY AND TREND IN RIO BRANCO,ACRE,BRAZILIn the present work,the behavior of rain in the region of Rio Branco,based on long term observations,in situ ,for 31 years between 1970 and 2000 was studied.It was observed a tendency to the increase of the volume ofannual precipitations before 1990,followed by a reduction of this volume,until 2003.The aim of this work isto call attention to a possible relation between the behavior of rainfalls in Rio Branco and the consolidation ofdeforestation in regions of eastern and central Amazonia that happened during the analyzed period.Although,theexplanation to this behavior is difficult to establish,it is known that changes in thermal balance between groundand atmosphere after deforestation,as well as atmospheric pollution due to forest burning,can lead to convectivechanges,influenced by loss of ground and vegetation humidity and also to suppression of cloud formation.As aconsequence,a likely relation of impact of the deforestation over the regional climate could be expected.Key words:Rainfall variability;Amazonian deforestation.</p>
