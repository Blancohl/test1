<p class="pageheader"><strong>Carbon limitations to nitrous oxide emissions in a humid tropical forest of the Brazilian Amazon</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">The availability of labile organic C for microbial metabolic processes could be an important factor regulating N2O emissions from tropical soils. We explored the effects of labile C on the emissions of N2O from a forest soil in the State of Rondonia in the southwestern quadrant of the Brazilian Amazon. We measured emissions of N2O from a forest soil after amendments with solutions containing glucose, water only or NO3-. Addition of glucose to the forest soil resulted in very large increases in N2O emissions whereas the water only and NO3- additions did not. These results suggest a strong C limitation on N2O production in this forest soil in the southwestern Amazon</p>
