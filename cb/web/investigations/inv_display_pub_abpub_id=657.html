<p class="default-style">[1] Records of atmospheric CO2 and (CO2)-C-13 can be used to distinguish terrestrial vs. oceanic exchanges of CO2 with the atmosphere. However, this approach has proven difficult in the tropics, partly due to extensive land conversion from C-3 to C-4 vegetation. We estimated the effects of such conversion on biosphere- atmosphere C-13 exchange for 1991-2000, and then explored how this \'land-use disequilibrium\'\' altered the partitioning of net atmospheric CO2 exchanges between ocean and land using NOAA-CMDL data and a 2D, zonally averaged atmospheric transport model. Our results suggest sizable CO2 uptake in C-3-dominated tropical regions in 8 of the 10 years; 1997 and 1998, which included a strong ENSO event, are near neutral. Since these fluxes include any deforestation source, our findings imply either that such sources are smaller than previously estimated, and/or the existence of a large equatorial terrestrial CO2 sink</p>
