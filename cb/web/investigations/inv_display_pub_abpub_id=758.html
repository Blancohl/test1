<p class="pageheader"><strong>Seasonal changes in chlorophyll distributions in Amazon floodplain lakes derived from MODIS images</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">To assess seasonal changes in phytoplanktonic chlorophyll distributions in Amazon floodplain lakes, a linear mixing model was applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data acquired at four river stages: rising (April), high (June), decreasing (September), and low (November). The study area is located in a floodplain reach from Parintins (Amazonas) to near Almeirim (Para). A three-end-member mixing model designed to uncouple three fractions [high suspended inorganic matter (ip), low inorganic suspended matter (w), and high chlorophyll a (Chl)] was tested in Lake Curuai (1.5 degrees S 55.43 degrees W) based on field sampling done almost concurrently with satellite overpasses. During high water, phytoplankton patches are confined to lakes closer to terra firme under the influence of clear water inflow, whereas during the low and decreasing water stages, the patches are more evenly distributed over the floodplain.</p>
