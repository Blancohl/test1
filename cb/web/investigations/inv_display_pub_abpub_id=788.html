<p class="pageheader"><strong>Roads Investments, Spatial Intensification and Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon </strong></p>

<p class="default-style">Understanding the impact of road investments on deforestation is part of acomplete evaluation of the expansion of infrastructure for development.We find evidenceof spatial spillovers from roads in the Brazilian Amazon: deforestation rises in the censustracts that lack roads but are in the same county as and within 100 km of a tract witha new paved or unpaved road. At greater distances from the new roads the evidence ismixed, including negative coefficients of inconsistent significance between 100 and 300km, and if anything, higher neighbor deforestation at distances over 300 km.</p>
