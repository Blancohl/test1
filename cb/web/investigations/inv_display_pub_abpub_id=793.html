<p class="pageheader"><strong>Beyond Population and Environment: Household Life Cycle Demoraphy and Land Use Allocation among Small Farm Colonists in the Amazon. </strong></p>

<p class="default-style">Most research featuring demographic factors in environmental change hasfocused on processes operating at the level of national or global populations. This paperfocuses on household-level demographic life cycles among colonists in the Amazon, andevaluates the impacts on land use allocation. The analysis goes beyond prior research byincluding a broader suite of demographic variables, and by simultaneously assessing theirimpacts on multiple land uses with different economic and ecological implications. Weestimate a system of structural equations that accounts for endogeneity among land uses,and the findings indicate stronger demographic effects than previous work. These findings bear implications for modeling land use, and the place of demography in environmental research.</p>
