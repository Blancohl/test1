<p class="pageheader"><strong>Unofficial road building in the Brazilian Amazon: dilemmas and models for road governance</strong></p>

<p class="default-style">Unofficial roads form dense networks in landscapes, generating a litany of negative ecological outcomes, but in frontier areas they are also instrumental in local livelihoods and community development. This trade-off poses dilemmas for the governance of unofficial roads. Unofficial road building in frontier areas of the Brazilian Amazon illustrates the challenges of \'road governance.\' Both state-based and community-based governance models exhibit important liabilities for governing unofficial roads. Whereas state-based governance has experienced difficulties in adapting to specific local contexts and interacting effectively with local peoples, community-based governance has a mixed record owing to social inequalities and conflicts among local interest groups. A state-community hybrid model may offer more effiective governance of unofficial road building by combining the oversight capacity of the state with locally-grounded community management via participatory decision-making.</p>
