<td span=row valign="top" align="left">
The Amazon basin is the world\'s largest tropical floodplain river system,  draining approximately 40% of South America. Water levels in the main rivers vary by, on average, 7 to 13m annually, and these fluctuations are responsible for the movement of water, which exerts a strong influence on the aquatic vegetationn and fauna. About 8000 lakes occur in the central Amazon.  Amazon inland waters are optically complex, spanning a wide variability in the concentration of phytoplankton pigments, and suspended and dissolved organic and inorganic matter. Therefore, a challenging problem, in a region as large as the Amazon basin, is to determine routing and changes of the inundating waters based on sparse ground measurements. Remote sensing offers the potential to examine optical properties and exchanges of water in rivers and lakes.  The operational application of the technology for water quality management is limited for several reasons. The available technology has not been able to deal with the complexity of inland aquatic systems. Coarse spatial and spectral resolution and low radiometric sensitivity has prevented the widespread use of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) Satellite pour l\'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) HRV images. The lack of understanding of how water quality variables affect the remotely sensed reflectance has prevented the development of new algorithms tailored to a wide range of environments. Field spectroradiometry involves the study of the relationship between the spectral characteristics and their chemical and biophysical attributes.  We applied this approach to the waters of the central Amazon. Spectra were  measured concurrently with water sampling for optically active components. Using  these data, we evaluated two spectral band operators for estimating chlorophyll concentrations from reflectance spectra of turbid waters.

Quality Assessment:<br><br>Water chemistry:<br><br>Accuracy for chlorophyll-a lab analysis was 0.1 mg/m3. Accuracy for determination of total suspended solids and inorganic suspended solids was 0.005 mg/L. Organic suspended solids concentration was calculated as the difference between total suspended solids and inorganic suspended solids. Field and lab manipulations may change DIC concentration of water samples slightly. <br><br><br><br>Specifications of parameters measured with a routinely calibrated Horiba U-10 water quality meter:<br><br><br><br>pH: Glass electrode, resolution: 0.01 pH units, repeatability: 0.05 pH units, temperature compensation: 0-50 degrees C.<br><br><br><br>Conductivity: Alternating four-electrode, resolution: for the range of 0 to 1 uS per cm 0.01 uS per cm, for the range of 1 to 10 uS per cm 0.1 uS per cm and for the range of 10 to 100 uS per cm 1.0 uS per cm, repeatability: plus or minus 1 percent of full scale, temperature compensation: 0-50 degrees C.<br><br><br><br>Turbidity: Scattering/transmitting light, resolution: 1 NTU, repeatability: plus or minus 3 percent of full scale, temperature compensation: N/A.<br><br><br><br>Temperature: Thermister, resolution: 0.1 degree C, repeatability: plus or minus 0.3 degrees C, temperature compensation: N/A<br><br><br><br>Radiometric and wavelength calibration are described at url: snr.unl.edu/agmet/instrument-se590-main.asp. <br><br><br><br>In addition to the nominal accuracy constraints of Spectron SE-590 and <br><br>the calibration of the barium sulphate (BaSO4) plate, variable field <br><br>conditions affect water reflectance measurements in ways that are <br><br>difficult to determine. Despite the procedures described in the methods <br><br>section, which were adopted to minimize interferences, unknown <br><br>inaccuracies of water reflectance measurements derive mainly from the <br><br>following changes of conditions at the time of sampling: roughness of <br><br>water surface, cloud cover movements, and geometry of acquisition <br><br>(hand-held operation of the sensor from a boat vessel subject to <br><br>movements from wave action). In general, these sources of inaccuracies <br><br>produce an additive reflectance effect in the 400 to 900 nm wavelength <br><br>range of interest. Rudorff et al.

Data Acquisition Materials and Methods:<br><br>Study sites:<br><br><br><br>Our study was conducted in the central Amazon basin in the low lying varzea of<br><br>the Solimoes River (varzea is the local name for floodplain formed by the overflow of white water rivers) and igapo (igapo is the local name for floodplain formed by the overflow of black water rivers) of the Negro River. White water is characteristic of the Solimoes main stem and some of the floodplain lakes connected to the river. They are rich in dissolved and suspended materials drained from the Andes. The black water is the dominant water in the Negro River and it is characterized by a low concentration of suspended and dissolved components, except for a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon.<br><br><br><br>During July 2000 the Amazon floodplain aquatic systems were sampled to build<br><br>a spectral library composed of 60 complete sets (in situ reflectance, water samples for chemical analyses, and in situ water measurements) and 90 incomplete sets (in situ reflectance and in situ water measurements). The main axis of the lake was determined and divided into equidistant segments. The sampling stations were set in places free from bottom effects. At every sampling station, the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) was measured from a boat using a portable spectrometer (Spectron SE-590). The sensor collected data in the 400 to 900 nm range at spectral intervals of 3 nm and with a 15 degree field-of-view (FOV) lens attached. A polarized lens was attached to the sensor to correct for sky reflection from the water surface. A barium sulphate (BaSO4) plate of known reflectance was used as reference. The water leaving radiance (Lw) was measured keeping the sun-sensor azimuth at 90 degrees and aiming at the water surface at a 45 degrees zenith angle to reduce sky radiance and the surface reflectance (Steffen et al. 1993). The radiance of the reference panel to a laboratory reflectance standard (Lr) was measured at the same geometry. Each of the sampled spectra was the average of four readings. Water samples were collected at three depths with a Van Dorn bottle and combined before being used for determination of dissolved and suspended components. The following variables were determined from water samples: total suspended solids (mg per L) according to Wetzel and Likens (1991), chlorophyll concentration (mg per m3) according to Nush (1980) and dissolved organic carbon (mg per L) according to APHA (1998). The following in situ measurements were obtained with a Horiba U-10 Water Quality Checker: conductivity, pH and depth. Each sampling station was classified by visual assessment of water colour into three broad classes: white, clear or black. Secchi depth was measured with a white 20 cm Secchi disk.<br><br>References:<br><br>APHA, 1998, Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20 edn<br><br>(Washington, DC: American Public Health Association).<br><br><br><br>Nush, E.A., 1980, Comparison of different methods for chlorophyll and phaeopigment determination.
