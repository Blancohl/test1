<td span=row valign="top" align="left">
This dataset examines the impact of termite mounds on an array of soil properties at a secondary forest site in Central Amazonia. Soil physical, chemical, hydraulic, and microbiological properties are measured in comparison to adjacent control soil. Comparisons of some measures of carbon and nitrogen cycling are also made. This dataset also contains a comparison of the termite species composition of low- and high-diversity agroforestry systems with primary forest.

Few data are available on the impact of termite mounds on soil and land productivity in Amazonia in general, so these data could be useful to compare to other sites. In comparisons to other locations, researchers should note that the study site was chosen in order to investigate an area with an apparently high density of termite mounds, so this site is not necessarily representative of any particular area.

Data Acquisition Materials and Methods:<br><br>The soils used in this study was collected from sites located at the Embrapa research station in the Distrito Agropecuario da SUFRAMA, located at km 53 of the federal highway BR 174 outside Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.  Soils on the plateau of the study site are classified as dystrophic, isohyperthermic, clayey kaolinitic Hapludox.  The climate is tropical humid, and mean annual rainfall is 2200 mm.<br><br><br><br>The site was first cleared for pasture in the late 1970s and later abandoned to secondary vegetation. The secondary forest transects were in a 7-8 year old secondary forest dominated by Vismia spp and located at 2 30\' 42 S and 60 01\' 29 W. The pasture site was located at approximately 2 31\' 02 S and 60 01\' 50 W. The agroforestry site was located at 02 31\' 04 S, 60 01\' 50 W. <br><br><br><br>Methods:<br><br><br><br>Termite mound abundance and area:<br><br>Termite mound abundance and area covered were determined at the secondary forest site in April of 2000. To estimate termite mound abundance and area covered, transects were made and surveyed through the secondary forest site.<br><br><br><br>Land use and termite species composition survey:<br><br>Three land uses were chosen for this study: a primary forest, a home-garden agroforest, and a palm-based agroforest. The home-garden and palm-based agroforests had been established on pastureland abandoned 10 yr prior to this study. Each plot measured 50 x 60 m. The agroforests were replicated on three blocks according to their land-use history: blocks one, two, and three had been in pasture for 4, 5, and 8 yr previously, and in fallow for 3, 4, and 5 yr prior to the establishment of the agroforests. These sites occurred on the plateau of the study site, and were surrounded by primary forest on the surrounding slopes. The primary forest site sampled was 3500 m away, selected as the nearest accessible primary forest on the study site that also occurred on the plateau. Three plots were chosen in the primary forest, at the same distance apart as the plots in the agroforests.<br><br><br><br>Termite species composition was assessed using a modified rapid biodiversity assessment protocol. The method employs a 100-m belt transect with 20 contiguous 2 x 5 m sections sampled sequentially. Transect length was limited to 50 m, the width of the agroforestry plots. A transect was established through the middle of each plot, amounting to three transects in each land cover, nine in total. A team of two collectors sampled as many species as possible in 30 min in each 2 x 5 m section. Collection was done in soil, litter, dead wood, mounds, nests, soil to 5 cm depth, and runways to 2 m height in the vegetation. The presence of a species in each section was considered an encounter and used as a surrogate for relative abundance. Observations on feeding substrates and nesting locations were recorded simultaneously.<br><br><br><br>Termites were preserved in vials of 80 percent ethanol and labeled with section number for later identification to species or morphospecies. The collection was deposited in the Entomological Museum of the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA), Brazil.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Soil hydraulic properties:<br><br>Water-stable aggregates: <br><br>Water-stable aggregation was measured using samples from the secondary forest site, in May and June of 2001. To evaluate water-stable aggregates, an auger was used to sample the surface 10 cm of soil. The two treatments were termite mound and adjacent soil. The adjacent soil sample was taken 1.5 m from the base of the termite mound. Each mound was selected randomly from a previous survey of the area. Roots and charcoal were removed from the samples. 25 g of soil composed of particulates of between 2 and 4 mm was selected from each sample. Around 10 g of soil was used to determine the moisture content of each sample. The 25 g of soil was agitated mechanically in water for 10 minutes, through sieves of 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm aperture. The soil in each category was dried at 105 C for at least 24 hours and weighed.<br><br><br><br>Soil hydrophobicity: <br><br>The soil hydrophobicity data were collected in May of 2001, using soil from the secondary forest site. For the soil hydrophobicity experiment, soil clods from termite mound, control soil, and a termite mound that had been exposed to fire were evaluated for their rate of water absorption.<br><br><br><br>Soil infiltration: <br><br>Data were collected on September 5 2000 at the secondary forest site. Soil infiltration was measured by inserting a stainless steel 20 cm tall 10 cm into the soil surface. A constant head of water was maintained in the cylinder for 10 minutes, and the amount of water lost was recorded.<br><br><br><br>Water retention: <br><br>The water retention curve of termite mound and control soil cores was evaluated by the tension table method (Reeve & Carter, 1991). Cores were saturated and then re-weighed at 0, 4, 10, 25, 30, 63, and 80 cm of water of tension. After 80 cm of tension, the samples were transferred to a pressure-plate apparatus and weighed after equilibrating at pressures equivalent to columns of 100 and 1000 cm of water. Oven dry weights were determined after the experiment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Soil physical and chemical characteristics:<br><br><br><br>Soil texture:<br><br>Soil texture samples were collected in May 2000 at the secondary forest and Aug 4 2000 at the pasture sites. For soil texture measurements, an auger was used to sample the surface 10 cm of soil.  The two treatments were termite mound and adjacent soil.  The adjacent soil sample was taken 1.5 m from the base of the termite mound. Each sampling point was a composite of three samples. Sand fractions were separated by wet sieving and clay and silt fractions were determined using the sieve-pipette sedimentation method fro clay (EMBRAPA 1997). Dispersion was done using 1N NaOH and mechanical agitation. The Brazilian classification system was used to determine particle size classes (EMBRAPA 1997)<br><br><br><br>Resistance:<br><br>Soil resistance to penetration was measured in the secondary forest site on Aug 2, 2000 and in the pasture site on September 5, 2000. Resistance measurements were made using an Ejkelkamp penetrometer with a cone with surface area of 2 sq. cm and penetration depth of 5 cm.  10 termite mounds and 10 adjacent control areas were sampled in the secondary forest and 7 in the pasture.  5 readings were taken on each mound and each treatment in the secondary forest, and 3 each in the pasture.<br><br><br><br>Soil water content:<br><br>The soil water content samples were collected on July 13 2000 from the secondary forest site, and on 4-5 September of 2000 from the pasture site.  Measurements were made by sampling with 100-cubic-cm cylinders on the soil surface.  9 termite mounds and 9 adjacent control areas were sampled in the secondary forest and 4 each in the pasture. 3 samples were taken from each mound and each treatment.  Samples were reweighed after being dried at 105C.<br><br><br><br>Soil bulk density data: <br><br>The pasture soil bulk density samples were collected on September 4 and 5 of 2000. and the secondary forest soil bulk density samples were collected on July 13, 2000.  Bulk density measurements were made by sampling with 100 cubic cm cylinders on the soil surface.  9 termite mounds and 9 adjacent control areas were sampled in the secondary forest, and 6 each in the pasture. 3 samples were taken from each mound and each treatment.<br><br><br><br>Soil chemistry:<br><br>The soil chemistry data were collected in May 2000 at the secondary forest site. For the soil chemistry data, an auger was used to sample the surface 10 cm of soil.  The two treatments were termite mound and adjacent soil.  The adjacent soil sample was taken 1.5 m from the base of the termite mound. Each sampling point was a composite of three samples. <br><br><br><br>Methods:<br><br>Carbon was determined by the Walkley-Black method, and total soil nitrogen (N) by the Kjeldahl technique. Available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K) were extracted using a double-acid solution of 0.05 N hydrochloric acid and 0.025 N sulfuric acid. Exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and Al were extracted with 1 N potassium chloride. Iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) were extracted with a Mehlich 1 solution in a 1:5 ratio and determined on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AA-1475, Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA).<br><br><br><br>Nitrogen mineralization:<br><br>Five termite mounds and control sites were sampled. Termite mound material was collected from the upper 10 cm of the mound surface using a composite of four samples.  Control soil was similarly collected from an area 1.5 m from the border of the termite mound.<br><br>Moisture content of each sample was determined in the laboratory.  In the broken treatment, aggregates were broken by hand to a consistent size.  For the elevated moisture treatment, gravimetric water content was increased to a moisture level 10% higher than field content.  Water was added three times a week to maintain the desired water contents.  Closed containers  with a large headspace were used, and a hole in the lid was made to maintain gas exchange.<br><br>At 0, 8, 43, and 66 days, 25 g subsamples from the incubations were extracted with 75 mL KCl by shaking for 30 minutes.  NH4+ and NO3- determinations were made using a Skalar continuous flow analyzer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Soil biology:<br><br><br><br>Root biomass:<br><br>Root biomass samples were collected at the secondary forest site on Jun 26 2001. Root biomass measurements were made by sampling with 100 cubic cm cylinders on the soil surface.  19 randomly selected termite mounds and 19 adjacent control areas were sampled.  A flat intact surface was chosen for sampling on each mound.<br><br><br><br>Microbial groups<br><br><br><br>Twenty termite mounds were randomly selected from the secondary-forest study site for sampling.  Three 10-cm surface samples from each mound were collected with an auger and bulked into a composite sample.  The adjacent soil (1.5 m in distance in a random direction) was likewise sampled.  Each sample was shaken with sterilized water and glass beads for ten minutes and a dilution series was made from 10-3 to 10-7.<br><br><br><br>40 g of soil from each sample were dried at 105 C for 24 h and the loss in weight measured.  A strip of Whatman No. 1 filter paper was added to a vial containing 10 mL of Jensens medium.  The cellulose medium was composed of 1.0 g (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4 7H2O, 0.2 g NaCl, 2.0 g CaCO3, and 1000 mL tap water.  The vials were incubated for seven days and counted as positive if microbial growth or break-up of the paper strip was observed.<br><br><br><br>The same dilutions used for determining populations of cellulose-decomposing microorganisms were used in an experiment to compare ammonifier populations.  Methods for estimating the population of ammonifying microorganisms were followed according to Andrade et al. (1994).  Vials with orange coloration were counted as negative for ammonifying microorganisms and vials with pink or yellow coloration were counted as positive.  The most probable number of microorganisms was calculated using the DOS application MPNES (Woomer et al., 1990).<br><br><br><br><br><br>Soda lime assessment of soil respiration<br><br><br><br>Eight termite mounds were selected randomly from the termite mounds at the secondary forest study site.  A 20-cm polyvinyl chloride ring 10 cm in height was pushed into the soil to a depth of 2-3 cm in each sampling location.  Two corresponding rings were likewise installed at 1.5 m from the termite mound in the control soil to comprise the two control treatments.  All litter was removed from the surface of the soil in one of the control treatments.<br><br><br><br>At sampling an open tin of soda lime was placed inside a covered chamber for 24 hours, then capped and re-weighed.  A blank was used at each sampling session.  The increase in dry mass of the soda lime was converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) using the factor 1.69 to correct for the chemical formation of water (Grogan, 1998).  Respiration was measured at three sampling events.  During each event, four of the eight sites were measured on the first day, and the other four sites on the next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Seedling studies<br><br>Soil cores were collected in 100 cm3 stainless steel cylinders. To remove mechanical barriers to germination, the material was ground to a texture favorable to seedling development. Autoclaving was used to denature any allelopathic organic substances, as in Rogers et al. (1999). Soil acidity, a potential barrier to germination and seedling development, was corrected by amendment with lime (20 and 12 mg of lime per cylinder in the ground and intact treatments,respectively).Six seeds of the native Sesbania exasperata were planted per experimental unit. Each factorial combination of the experiment<br><br>had five experimental units, for a total of 480 seeds. Each of the eighty 100 cm3 cylinders received 10 mL of water daily as needed. Germination was recorded daily for nine days. The emergence velocity index (EVI) (Mendonca, 1997) of the seeds was calculated.<br><br>References:<br><br>Andrade, D.d.S., M. Miyazawa, and P.J.
