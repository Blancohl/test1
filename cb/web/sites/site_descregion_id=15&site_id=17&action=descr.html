Amazonas (Manaus) - EMBRAPA DAS Experiment - km 54 (CPAA)
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Embrapa DAS Experiment site (Embrapa&#8211;CPAA pasture research station) is located 54 km north of Manaus on the highway BR 174 Manaus-Boa Vista at 60 m elevation.  This station is only a few kilometers away from the INPA tower and forest management areas.  The site is characterized by a rolling topography with plateaus and small valleys, and the dominant vegetation at the site is evergreen forest.  The soil type is a Xanthic Hapludox, which is the major soil type in the central Amazon.  There is good access to both old and newly established pastures in conditions representative of those faced by small farmers. Approximately 200 hectares of a forest were cleared and burned in the 1980&#8217;s, and Brachiaria humidicola pastures were established.  Secondary succession of the pastures began soon after pasture establishment.  Studies on vegetation characterization at the site have resulted in the identification of 39 species representing 34 genera and 23 families.  The most abundant tree species were Laetia procera, Vismia amazonica, V. lateriflora, and V. cayennensis.  The most frequently encountered herbaceous species were the competitive forbs Borreria verticillata and Rolandra fruticosa.  The species and genera detected at this site have also been reported in species inventories of abandoned pastures at other locations in Amazonia.  </p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
