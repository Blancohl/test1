Amazonas (Manaus) - ZF3 Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP)
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) is located 70–90 km north of Manaus near Km. 64 of BR 174 Manaus-Boa Vista Highway.  It is in the Distrito Agropecuario, an area of approximately 500,000 ha of relatively undisturbed upland forest under development by the Manaus Free Trade Zone Authority (SUFRAMA).  The project was initiated in 1979 as a joint Brazilian (INPA) and U.S. (World Wildlife Fund) project, with the original research goal of identifying the minimum size of tropical forest habitat that would maintain most of the biotic diversity of an intact ecosystem (Lovejoy et al., 1986).  This site is currently managed by INPA and the Smithsonian Institute, and has an elevation range from 80–110 meters.  The predominant vegetation is non-flooded (terra firme) lowland tropical moist forest, far from large rivers and associated riverine habitats.  Soils are nutrient–poor clay yellow Latosols (Xanthic Ferralsols). Forests are 30–37 m in height with emergents to 45–55 m.  Based on a sample of 31 ha over a roughly 40–km transect the four most abundant tree families were Burseraceae, Sapotaceae, Leguminoseae, and Lecythidaceae. The most species rich were Sapotaceae (est. 72 species), Chrysobalanaceae (est. 58–80 species), Annonaceae, and Lecythidaceae (39 species).  The research landscape of the BDFFP is composed of large cattle ranches cleared of forest in the early 1980s.  These areas now include primary forest patches of varying sizes, extensive areas of mature continuous forest, and a matrix of cattle pastures and abandoned areas that are in different stages of forest regeneration. Information on the BDFFP research site was gathered from the BDFFP web page.</p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
