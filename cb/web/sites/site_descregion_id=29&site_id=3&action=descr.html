Rondonia - Ariquemes
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariquemes lies on the BR 364 highway, between Porto Velho and Ji–Paraná, in the state of Rondônia.  As a contribution to LBA, the EOS Amazon Project has initiated a mesoscale study of the effects of regional–scale land–use change on the hydrologic response and biogeochemistry of rivers with drainage areas of order 1,000–10,000 km2 in Rondônia.  The study is being conducted in a group of river basins that drain northward through the state, and have differing amounts of deforestation, ranging from nearly zero to approximately 50% of basin area, gauged by the Brazilian National Department of Water and Electrical Energy (DNAEE).  The Jaci–Paraná, Candeias, Jamari, and Ji–Paraná drainage basins are gauged in nested series with areas ranging from approximately 3,000 to 31,000 km2.  The aim of the LBA/EOS Amazon investigation is to document and explain the loading of runoff, sediment and bioactive chemicals into the rivers of the region, both under original forest cover and under conditions disturbed by land use. </p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
