Rondonia - Fazenda Nossa Senhora
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazenda Nossa Senhora (10° 45' 44" S, 62° 21' 27" W) is located approximately 15 km northwest of Ouro Preto d'Oeste and sits 230m above sea level.  This experimental site is in a planal area, surrounded by a series of colinies within 4 to 10km from the site.  The site was deforested in 1977 and burned during the height of the dry season (August to October).  Several food crops have been cultivated in the area (e.g. rice, beans, corn), but when the production of the plantations declined in the following years grass (Brachiaria brizanth) was planted.  The current flora consists of brachiaria brizanth, with small areas of  Panicum maximum, palms, and shrubs.<br><br>The CD-207 group built a 10m tower at this site in March of 1999.  Meteorological, as well as solar and terrestrial radiation, data are monitored at this site since its construction.  A eddy covariance system has been installed next to the tower atop a 4m post, measuring the energy and CO2 flux between the ground and the atmosphere.</p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
