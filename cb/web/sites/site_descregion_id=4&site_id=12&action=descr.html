Pará Eastern (Belém) - Jari Celulose
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jarí Celulose Forestry Project is headquartered in the town of Monte Dourado, Pará.  Jari Celulose is a private company that grows eucalyptus for fiber production as well as other plantation species (e.g., Gmelina arborea and Pinus caribaea).  The project is surrounded by and immediately adjacent to primary forest that has no recent history of human intervention, with the possible exception of extractive practices such as Brazil nut gathering, hunting, and other low-impact activities.  Because the property is privately owned, there is well–established land tenure, which facilitates long–term research project stability.  Auburn University has signed a research agreement with Jarí Celulose and has worked collaboratively with the company in the past.  The Jarí property is located on both sides of the Jarí River, the first major tributary flowing south into the Amazon River, at approximately 1°S and 52°W.  Rainfall averages 2,115 mm annually, varying from 290 mm in May to 41 mm in October, with a brief but distinct dry season from September to November.  The average annual temperature is 26.4°C, varying less than 2° monthly.  Natural vegetative cover may be classified as semi–evergreen forest with layered tree canopy, high floristic diversity, and few herbaceous species.  Forest inventories have shown at least 507 woody plant species on the property with representation of common tropical botanical families: Sapotaceae, Leguminaceae, Lecythidaceae, Meliaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myristicaceae.  Jarí has mapped soils found on the property into 25 categories based on extensive field observations and laboratory analysis (Corrê et al., 1989).  These fall into one of five general soil types: yellow and red–yellow Latosols (74% of the property), Podzols (16%), Cambisols (7%), Plinthosols (2%), and alluvial soils (1%).  </p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
