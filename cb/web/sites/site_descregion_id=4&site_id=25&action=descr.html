Pará Eastern (Belém) - Ponta de Pedras
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponta de Pedras, on the Marajó Island of Pará, represents a transitional environment composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils.  There is a wide range of vegetative cover at this site, including upland floodplain forests, palm–dominated forests, flooded forests, açai palm agroforestry, and different types of savannas.  The land uses in the area are swidden and mechanized agriculture, logging, and agroforestry.  This site has been historically occupied by Caboclo (non–native American indigenous Amazonian populations, or traditional populations that live on the island of Marajó and elsewhere) populations devoted to agroforestry activities in the floodplain and swidden agriculture in the uplands.  Previously collected field data from this site are being used in a Land–Cover Land–Use Change model and no ground measurements are planned at this time.  Studies here will focus on three areas occupied by Caboclo populations where household–level socioeconomic and demographic assessments have already been completed.  Each of these three areas characterizes a particular land use system: long–fallow swidden agriculture, agroforestry, or mechanized agriculture (Murrieta et al., 1989; Brondizio et al., 1994; Brondizio, 1996).  </p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
