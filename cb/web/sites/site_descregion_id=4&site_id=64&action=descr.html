Pará Eastern (Belém) - Fazenda Cauaxi
</p>

<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazenda Cauaxí is in the Ulianópolis Municipality of Pará.  The Tropical Forest Foundation maintains a logging camp and school for demonstration of forest management techniques at this site.  Training courses, demonstration and research activities have been conducted there since 1995 with the collaboration of property owners.   Prior to current logging operations, there is no historical record of land use or collection of non-timber forest products although there are indicators of indigenous activity.  Ranchers and loggers first entered the area in 1976 through the Rio Capim and the Rio Surubiju.  There were no roads in the area until the 1980's. The climate at Fazenda Cauaxi is humid tropical.  Total annual precipitation averages about 2200 mm.  A dry season extends from July through November (generally <50 mm/month) although June and December are also frequently dry enough for logging operations.  Soils in the area are classified mainly as dystrophic yellow latosols according to the Brazilian system.  The topography is mainly flat to mildly undulating.  The forest at Fazenda Cauaxi is classified as tropical dense moist forest.  The most common timber species that were harvested during five years of forest operations are Licania sp., Manilkara huberii, Astronium lecointei, Eschweilera odorata, and Parkia spp.  Stand basal area is approximately 57 m2 ha-1 for trees greater than 10 cm diameter at breast height.</p><div align="center"><p class="pathmenu"><a href="javascript:void(window.close())">Close Window</a></p></div>
