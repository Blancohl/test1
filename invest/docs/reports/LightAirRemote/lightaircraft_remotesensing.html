<p>Abstract</p></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NASA's LBA-ECO Project sponsored a two-day workshop, entitled the
&quot;NASA LBA-ECO Light Aircraft Remote Sensing Instrumentation Workshop,&quot; at
the Inn and Conference Center of the University of Maryland during October 6-7, 1997. The
workshop was designed to explore the current &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; in operational
small aircraft remote sensing instrumentation and to recommend several optional packages
that meet the projected remote sensing (RS) needs of NASA's LBA-ECO Project in the
Amazon area. Experts in airborne remote sensing from NASA, USDA, universities, and private
companies provided combined experience in excess of 200 years of airborne remote sensing.
An overview of LBA and NASA's role in the LBA project set the focus for the required
capability of the RS package, which may be developed in multiples for co-location at
several intensive study sites for the three to five-year period of the study. The workshop
was very productive, as three primary instrument packages were &quot;designed.&quot; The
proposed configurations were based on &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; products, and approximate
costs were developed. A nominal $500K targeted cost for instrument package development,
including components and integration for a single (first) operational unit was used the to
scope the discussions. However, integration costs for the aircraft sensor package were not
well developed during the meeting, as the discussion focused on the available
instrumentation that should be considered for inclusion in such a package. The
capabilities of all three proposed packages exceed those of packages that have been flown
on small aircraft in previous field campaigns, but it will be essential for the LBA-ECO
science community to clearly identify the remote sensing parameters and
products needed in order to make a final selection of sensor components to be included in
the instrument package to be developed. The workshop participants made a concerted effort
not only to list the sensor characteristics and other engineering concerns, which was the
concentration of the expertise at the workshop, but also to identify the measured
parameters and potential usefulness of the proposed sensors to the ecological scientific
community. This report summarizes the discussions, issues and recommendations associated
with several topics relating to the development of an operational small aircraft remote
sensing instrumentation package. Two appendices follow the main report: I) the Workshop
Agenda, and II) a List of Participants.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) is an
international research initiative led by Brazil. LBA is designed to create the new
knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and
hydrological functioning of Amazonia, the impact of land use change on these functions,
and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. NASA's LBA-ECO Project is
a component of LBA that will focus on terrestrial ecology and land cover/land use change.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenges of working at diverse sites scattered throughout the
Amazon area make it difficult to monitor and compare study sites without remote sensing as
a tool. It may be necessary to deploy several light aircraft for measurements in key
locations for rapid response and frequent measurement capability at local sites. These
aircraft would carry integrated, well-tested remote sensing and ancillary instrument
packages with instrumentation similar or identical to each other. The proposed system must
respond to the needs of today's ecosystem scientists for local remote sensing data to
complement ground and satellite investigations. In order to cover such a large number of
sites spaced so far apart, the instrument package must be portable and versatile,
pragmatically functional, and relatively inexpensive so that it can be duplicated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of this workshop was to examine existing and somewhat
readily available hardware that could be assembled to produce an integrated remote sensing
instrument package. The package should be suitable for mounting on light aircraft, for use
in routine remote sensing missions over selected LBA targets and should have application
potential for other NASA planning activities requiring low-cost remote sensing. The
workshop purpose also encompassed identification of package measurement capability in
terms of ecological products. System design was driven by the requirement that it could be
assembled from off-the-shelf instrument components, take a variety of basic measurements
simultaneously, and be mounted on locally available aircraft. Desirable features for
individual instruments for the package were low cost, easy deployment, well-characterized
performance, good calibration, light weight, and low power consumption.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To accomplish these objectives, participants in this meeting were
invited based on their knowledge and experience with remote sensing hardware and
applications of this type of instrumentation. In an attempt to diversify the functionality
and capability of this sensor package and to get a wide perspective on solutions,
participants were invited from multiple agencies and organizations (universities, USDA,
NASA, and commercial industry). This resulted in an invitation list consisting mainly of
instrument engineers and technicians with a few researchers/scientists (see Appendix III).
Several instrument or vendor representatives were invited to aid in understanding
technical specifications and in the identification of capabilities, but the invitees were
instructed that it was not a forum sales or marketing opportunities; however, few were
able to attend. Participants were asked to share their knowledge about the advantages and
disadvantages, costs, and availability of various relevant instruments, mounting
platforms, and small aircraft. The participants who had recent experience with designing,
developing, integrating and deploying integrated small aircraft packages were asked to
present a brief overview of their system(s) and what they saw as critical issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to meet as many remote sensing needs as possible, the
instruments that participants attempted to investigate included:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thermal radiometers</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">High spatial resolution spectrometers</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cosine Collector Spectroradiometers or Sun Photometers</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Multi-angular radiometers</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CCD and video imagery instruments</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lidars and/or range-finders</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Radars and passive microwave instruments</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GPS units and CDI&#146;s (Course Deviation Indicators)</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cameras</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">with allowances made for possibly incorporating automated CO<sub>2</sub>
    and other gas sampling instruments onto the same aircraft platform.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to develop a viable sensor package several issues had to be
addressed so the constraints and requirements would be understood. They were:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Types of aircraft that might be available in Amazonia</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft operational limitations</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft functional limitations </p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basic measurement capability</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ancillary data and data systems</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Field operation limitations</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previous experiences</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Available operational sensors and equipment</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions of these issues raised even more questions and several
action items and charges resulted.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the issues above are presented in an organized list, the order
in which they were developed and discussed was not. The workshop was an iterative process,
which does not lend itself to a concise description of the results and ideas. With clarity
in mind, the specifics of this report will be organized around these issues and will be
developed in the order listed. The suggested instrument packages that followed from
looking at these issues will be presented from three perspectives to allow the reader to
view the information the way that seems most logical to him/her. Following this section is
a summary of recommendations and outstanding issues. Conclusions on the final
specifications of an instrument package must await specification of requirements by the
discipline scientists and clarification of the funding that will be available for the
initial instrument development and duplicate instrument production.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Types of aircraft that might be available in Amazonia</p>
  </b>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to assess a real constraint on the total size, weight, power
consumption, and mounting options, participants discussed what types of small aircraft
would most likely be available for rent in Amazonia. Initial research using Internet
searches across Brazilian web pages yielded links to several flying clubs in the more
developed areas of Brazil. The aircraft listed ranged from the ever-popular single engine
Cessna 182 and Piper Cherokee to the larger Piper Seneca-2. Some participants suggested
that LBA-ECO explore the option of using a larger aircraft already outfitted for
remote sensing and retaining it on a long-term contract to avoid many of the operational
and functional limitations. Another issue raised was NASA&#146;s policy regarding a
co-pilot in a multi-engine plane and how this might preclude NASA employees from flying
along in aircraft operations. This constraint will have to be investigated if a
multi-engine aircraft is used. However, concern was expressed about availability of
specialized aircraft and of larger aircraft in some of the more remote locations. It was
decided that participants should follow the conservative route and limit capabilities to
single engine aircraft such as the Cessna 182. A subsequent email received from Bernardo
Rudorff, Director of the Remote Sensing Branch at INPE, indicated that the Cessna 182 is
the most likely option. Some agreed that this would be a good &quot;design to&quot;
constraint, since the Cessna 182 is also readily available in North America.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft operational limitations</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the frequency of data collection and the enormous distances
between study areas and sites, it was obvious that the sensor packages would usually be
flown on small, low-cost rental aircraft operating from local airports. This implies that
the configuration would be limited very minor or no structural modifications to the
aircraft. Aircraft range limitations with a cargo such as the sensor package may force a
trade-off between number of passengers and flight duration. A discussion regarding typical
payload/flight duration/altitude trade-offs indicated that, for the short flight-lines and
windows of opportunity that will most likely exist due to cloud formation, the use of a
single engine Cessna is not an issue. The size of the aircraft, such as the Cessna 182,
will limit the number of instrument operators to one. It was suggested the package could
be flown without an operator in ER-2 fashion (pilot only), if the system could be
automated enough that the pilot could just turn it on and fly to the flight lines
pre-programmed into the CDI. This option received mixed reactions, based on the potential
need for an educated assessment of conditions for remote sensing on the fly.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft functional limitations </p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using a small, low-cost rental aircraft poses several inherent
functional limitations. Issues such as low power, low cargo mass and volume, lack of
instrument mounting hard-points or large ports for optical instruments, and a nonexistent
or inadequate INU (inertial navigation unit) or FMU (flight management unit) were
identified.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The potential lack of adequate instrument/experiment power led to
several suggestions, although no total power requirement has been calculated for any of
the three suggested packages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Only rent planes which have the necessary power capabilities and
  harnesses; </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Provide funds to upgrade an aircraft&#146;s generator and install
  needed harnesses and interfaces; </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) Take appropriate measures to reduce the system&#146;s power
  requirements to that of a stock Cessna 182's excess power; </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) Provide additional instrument package power in the form of a battery
  or UPS (Un-interruptible Power Supply). The latter would certainly require special effort
  to reduce system power consumption. One participant raised the issue of having a hazardous
  material, such as the UPS&#146;s lead acid battery, in the passenger compartment and this
  issue should be investigated with regard to Brazilian civil aviation law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Low cargo mass is a non-negotiable constraint that will require close
attention in the system design to make sure redundancy and excess instrument and rack
materials are removed. A related issue is the physical size of the system. The sensor
package portion of the system will have very limited space in whatever hole or pod it is
mounted. Control and data system rack size is an issue, since the aircraft (Cessna) is
very narrow, with a low ceiling. It was suggested that mechanical drawings of the aircraft
should be obtained to provide information during any future design brainstorming sessions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The low cargo volume constraint led to discussions about the lack of
instrument mounting hard-points on the outside of a rental aircraft , as well as the lack
of large ports for optical instruments. Since no one expected to find a large camera port
in a rented Cessna 182, participants focused on mounting equipment in ways which might
protrude from the aircraft. Participants were unsure about Brazilian civil aviation law
restrictions on mounting equipment to the outside or underside of an aircraft in a way
which might interfere with the aerodynamic characteristics of the Cessna 182, and this
issue was indicated as something to investigate further. Four primary options were
proposed for solving this problem and some combination may be the best solution if a
package with a large number of sensors is selected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Use a pre-approved aerodynamic sensor pod similar to EPA&#146;s
    Enviropod, which was flown strapped on the bottom of a Cessna 182.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Develop a &quot;baggage door insert&quot; which would house the
    fore-optics in a fiberglass aerodynamic faring that bulges out from the baggage door area.
    Xiu Hong Sun mentioned that TerraSystems has an FAA-approved replacement baggage door for
    a Cessna.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Replace a cockpit door/window with a similar faring, as in option 2.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Use fiber optics to bring light through small holes that may exist.
    This was identified as a good option for non-imaging systems only.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While these seem to be reasonable options, it was agreed that Brazilian
civil aviation law may either be a show-stopper or may add considerable cost for approval.
This issue will have to be investigated before a design is begun.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Small rental Cessna 182's generally do not have an adequate INU or FMU
by which the pilot can fly precise lines. They also rarely have a data output interface,
such as ARINC429, so flight position and attitude can be logged in the data stream to
allow geolocation of the data and images. This was not seen as a problem, since everyone
agreed that a good CDI and precise attitude and position would be required and most
available small aircraft INU&#146;s do not provide the precision and accuracy. It was
recommended to provide this capability as part of the carry-on package.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basic measurement capability </p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A mandatory issue to be resolved before hypothetical instrument
packages could be discussed was, &quot;What do we want to measure?&quot; This was somewhat
difficult since no one felt the workshop participants could speak for the LBA-ECO
Science Team, particularly since the Science Team had not yet been selected. Instead,
participants used a combination of experience from previous large-scale field campaigns
such as BOREAS and FIFE and other flight programs within which several participants had
been involved, in addtion to the information from the &quot;Role of Remote Sensing in
LBA&quot; section of NRA97mtpe02&nbsp;&nbsp; <font COLOR="#0000ff">http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/mtpe/nra97mtpe02/remote.html.</font></p>


<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parameters such as Spectral Radiance and Irradiance in the Visible
(VIS) through Infrared (IR) spectrums and Microwave/Longwave emissions or reflectance were
listed as measurements of interest; and optical sensing was expected to be a must-have in
an RS package. The issue of spectral resolution and coverage was addressed by offering
varying levels of capability in this area in the proposed packages. Measurement techniques
such as Lidar and Radar were identified as being of interest to researchers trying to
obtain biomass, topography and canopy structure. Imaging vs. profiling was briefly
discussed, but it was generally agreed that images, if affordable, would serve a much
broader need and could provide an &quot;historical&quot; site monitoring value as the
project progressed. Finally, the team felt that the design should leave open the
possiblity of aerosol/flux instruments in the package to help obtain the highest
scientific return per flight hour.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the workshop participants had experience with optical sensors,
both passive and active (LIDAR). Unfortunately, the invited experts in Microwave/Longwave
and Radar were unable to attend, and an outstanding issue is to investigate options for
Radars that might fit on a small aircraft and provide useful biophysical data. For these
reasons, the potential sensor packages are strong in optical and Lidar with no mention
made of radar. Subsequent investigation has shown that there are no known longwave
scatterometers that can be readily mounted on a small aircraft such as a Cessna 182. There
are some such instruments that have been flown on helicopters, and with some development
activity, radar instruments could likely be adapted to light aircraft operation. One of
the key practical problems is the size of the antenna that would need to be mounted
beneath the aircraft body.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ancillary data and data systems</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several ancillary data products were identified as important to
post-flight processing and should be included in whichever of the optional packages is
selected for development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video ground/sky-truth - use a bore-sighted down-looking color-video camera with a
    field-of-view (FOV) comparable to the other sensors to see where/what the sensors were
    looking at and an up-looking color-video camera with a wide-angle lens (~165-180<sup>o</sup>
    FOV; TBD) to document cloud and smoke distribution, since it will be nearly impossible to
    find &quot;golden day&quot; conditions that investigators have often waited for in
    aircraft campaigns in temperate climates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Accurate and precise position - Use a GPS/GLONAS satellite receiver to allow geolocation
    and accurate time stamping of data. This information will also feed into a CDI and/or
    Moving Map Display for the pilot and operator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Accurate and precise attitude - Use one of the new solid-state gyros to obtain
    acceptable performance for frame images or a fiber optic gyro (FOG) to obtain necessary
    precision and low-drift for pushbroom images and scanning lidar/rangefinder images.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The design of the data system came up early due to issues about the
number of operators, power and weight, and Brazilian law concerning remote sensing data
collection and distribution. It was generally felt that the data system should be
completely integrated into one computer system to reduce power, size, weight, operator
workload, and to provide one integrated data file that could be sent to the proper
Brazilian archive. Some participants expressed a concern that many of the proposed
instruments come with their own data systems and integrating them into one system could be
costly in terms of manpower on the initial prototype. This issue was left open-ended, to
be resolved once all instruments were selected. Ease of integration may be a factor in
instrument selection.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Field operation limitations </p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues and considerations were brought up concerning operations
in potentially hostile (to delicate equipment) environmental conditions. Given the
potential lack of a hangar to work on installation and removal and issues of availability
due to the aircraft being used for other work, everyone agreed that the package should be
easy to install, remove and calibrate. It was pointed out that one way to improve ease of
calibration is to insist that the instruments be independently radiometrically stable.
Environmental considerations such as rain, humidity, dust, and heat prompted suggestions
that all packages be environmentally sealed, temperature stabilized, and possibly dry
nitrogen purged. An expected lack of clean service laboratory space and parts supply
sources prompted requirements of system reliability and serviceability. Consequently,
instruments that have no proven track record and are &quot;experimental&quot; will most
likely not be considered. To improve serviceability, it was suggested that a modular
interface might make instrument swaps for service or reconfiguration much faster and might
not compromise package availability in the event of an untimely failure of a single
instrument. This approach would also allow multiple sensor locations to be utilized to
reduce the aperture size at an available mounting location.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Available Operational Sensors and Equipment</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a precursor to the workshop, a pre-workshop remote sensing
brainstorming session was held at Goddard Space Flight Center during June of 1997. In
response to the June session, organizers received several papers and data sheets
describing operational remote sensing systems. Philip Dabney/920.3/NASA-GSFC was charged
with the task of compiling this information into a database or matrix of sensor parameters
and of performing a thorough search for information on additional systems. During the
October workshop, several sources of available sensor information were used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual knowledge and familiarity with a sensor</li>
  <li>Philip Dabney&#146;s Airborne Sensor Database/Matrix containing relevant highlights from
    the next two sources and general Internet and literature searches.</li>
  <li>Tables and Matrices of Airborne Sensors compiled by others</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following pages contain tables of the three options developed for
LBA Light Aircraft Remote Sensing Packages. The first table is an attempt at presenting
the fundamental system characteristics information without the details that clutter the
full-information tables. The full-information tables are the final working view-graphs
from the workshop, containing all the modifications and iterations made by participants.
In the detailed tables, specific sensors were identified as possible candidates or as good
examples of the type of instrument participants wanted for that measurement &#151; not as
firm recommendations. Final prices and availability are still pending for most of the
items. Prices given on individual systems/instruments were ball-park and could carry up to
a 25% uncertainty. Additionally, participants did not try to attach a manpower estimate to
the task of designing and building the first unit. A few educated guesses placed the task
at approximately one person-year of an engineer/technician&#146;s time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time of the workshop, there were no small,
&quot;off-the-shelf&quot; commercial domestic hyperspectral sensors. The market will be
surveyed again before an actual design meeting takes place.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Aircraft Recommendations and Issues</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> The NASA LBA-ECO Project should be
      conservative and design a package that can be mounted on a single engine rental aircraft
      such as the Cessna 182. We have identified the Cessna 182 as the most likely aircraft in
      some of the remote sites.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Identify exact model of aircraft to be
      rented, since a large variation in capabilities and options exists within the Cessna 182
      model line, and obtain: available power, cargo mass and volume, INU and CDI capabilities,
      mounting options and limitations.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Investigate Brazilian civil aviation
      law restrictions on; mounting equipment to the outside or underside of an aircraft
      externally mounted pods (e.g., Enviropod&#146;s EPA), the use of modified baggage/entry
      doors (such as TerraSystems&#146; plexiglas bugle that fits in the baggage compartment),
      and limits on modifications on small aircraft.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Clarify NASA regulations on NASA
      employee official/working presence on an aircraft without a co-pilot</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> The package should provide a CDI
      and/or moving map display and software to allow fast programming of flight lines for these
      devices. It is unlikely that rental aircraft would have the capability needed for precise
      re-flights of the same lines. One option suggested was to adapt Wallops Flight
      Facilities&#146; CDI program, integrate it into the package data system, and give the
      pilot a separate display.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><b>Sensor Package Recommendations and Issues</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> All instruments used must be
      operational, not experimental, and have a history of reliable field performance and stable
      calibrations. The instruments should be &quot;catalogue&quot; items so multiple copies can
      be purchased.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Individual instruments should have
      modular aircraft-independent interface to allow fast installation, removal, servicing and
      upgrades. The interface should be mounted in such a way that eliminates the need for
      aircraft modifications (pod or modified replacement doors) and can be entirely removed and
      placed on another similar aircraft. Instruments or packages should have environmental
      seals and temperature and humidity control. A calibration method should be devised that
      will eliminate the need for removing the sensors from the aircraft.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Use a multi/hyperspectral imager for
      the VIS-NIR that at a minimum provides Landsat TM/ETM VIS-NIR coverage for scale-up and
      cal/val activities. A single band SWIR imager would be of great interest for atmospheric
      correction and soil classification.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Down-welling spectral irradiance is a
      must. This will allow better illumination modeling and possibly direct calculation of
      reflectance.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Provide canopy heights, roughness, and
      limited topography by using a low-cost two-hit laser range-finder.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Image rectification and registration
      are important and should be done using post-processing instead of a large, power-hungry
      stabilized mount. The method used to accomplish this will be based on a combination of INU
      attitude, differential GPS data, and image texture correlation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Video ground and sky-truth are
      important. Use a bore-sighted, down-looking, color-video camera with a field-of-view (FOV)
      comparable to the other sensors to see where/what the sensors were looking at and an
      up-looking color-video camera with a wide-angle lens (180<sup>o</sup> FOV?) to
      characterize cloud and smoke cover.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> A nadir and an off-nadir thermal IR
      spot measurements or profilers are a minimum for ground and canopy temperature
      measurement. An imager would add a lot to the science.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Reserve space in the design of the
      package for inclusion of gas flux instrumentation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Further explore the inclusion of a
      vegetation-radar in package.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Update the database of potential
      sensors, particularly: operational status of sensor, environmental restrictions,
      calibration stability, cost, weight, power, size, and purchasing lead-time.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> Data system and software requirements
      need to be identified. Should there be one integrated data system versus a distributed
      system with each instrument manufacturer&#146;s supplied data logger? Should there be one
      inclusive data file with all data and housekeeping?</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">Ø</font> INU and Differential GPS requirements
      need to be derived from Science Team requirements for precision and sensor selection. A
      method of differential GPS correction needs to be identified. A slight possibility exists
      that a broadcasted correction is available but most likely the project will have to set up
      ground stations (where?).</p>
