</b>

<p>The Amazon Basin, a vast area of 5.8 million square kilometers, contains almost one
half of the world's undisturbed tropical evergreen forest and a large area of tropical
savanna. The basin is important in the metabolism of the Earth, accounting for
approximately 10 percent of the terrestrial net primary production. Equally important, it
is a region of high biodiversity. Since the massive road-building efforts of the 1960's
and 1970's, the Brazilian portion of the Amazon Basin has experienced considerable
development. Large areas of forest and savanna have been cleared and converted to cattle
pastures or row-crop fields in several states including Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia.
Selective logging has changed the structure and composition of forested areas,
particularly in eastern Pará and along river courses. Based on research to date, we have
a general sense that these activities have caused changes in carbon and nutrient budgets
on land, the fluxes of gases between the land and the atmosphere, and the exchange of
materials between the land and river systems. We need additional research to refine our
understanding of the magnitudes of the changes and the controls on key biogeochemical
processes in Amazonia's ecosystems. An understanding of the controls on these processes is
essential for us to develop predictions of the consequences of changes in land cover and
land use.</p>

<p>In this document, we outline a plan to study the ecological and biogeochemical
consequences of land-use and land-cover changes in the Amazon. The plan has been developed
at five meetings held in the past two years: Brasília, Brazil, in September of 1993;
Piracicaba, Brazil, in May of 1994; Manaus, Brazil, in February of 1995; Manaus, Brazil,
in May of 1995; and Woods Hole, U.S.A., in August of 1995. More than 100 scientists from
Brazil, Europe and the United States have participated in the development of the study
plan.</p>

</u>

<p>The science question that will focus the ecological study in the Amazon is: </p>

<p><b>How do tropical forest conversion and re-growth, and selective logging, influence
carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes and surface water chemistry in the
Amazon?</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Forest conversion&quot; refers to forest clearing and conversion to agricultural
uses, especially cattle pasture, and &quot;forest re-growth&quot; refers to forest growth
following the abandonment of agricultural lands. The science question calls for an
explicit consideration of the effects of these land-cover and land-use changes on
terrestrial carbon and nutrient budgets, the fluxes of trace gases between the land and
the atmosphere, and the exchange of materials between the land and river systems.
Implicitly, the question also calls for an understanding of these budgets, fluxes and
exchanges in &quot;primary&quot; or pre-disturbance forest ecosystems.</p>

Study &#150; An Overview</a></p>
</u>

<p>The Amazon ecological study program will consist of five research themes: 1) land-cover
and land-use change, 2) terrestrial carbon budget, 3) plant and soil nutrient budgets, 4)
trace gas fluxes, and 5) dynamics of surface-water chemistry.</p>

<p>Theme 1, land-cover and land-use change, will focus on: documentation of past and
current land-cover and land-use changes throughout Amazonia and development of a
capability to predict the location and magnitude of future land-cover and land-use changes
in the region.</p>

<p>Theme 2, the terrestrial carbon budget, will involve quantification of the magnitude of
the carbon pools in vegetation and soils of intact forests and savannas, pastures,
cultivated lands, and second growth and selectively-logged forests. It will also involve
quantification of the rates of carbon exchange among the atmosphere, vegetation and soils,
and the ways these rates are altered by natural and human disturbances. </p>

<p>Theme 3, plant and soil nutrient budgets, will focus on the same two areas for
nutrients as Theme 2 will do for carbon. Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients of major
interest.</p>

<p>Theme 4, trace gas fluxes, will focus on: 1) quantification of the fluxes between the
land and the atmosphere; and 2) determination of how various factors control these fluxes.
First priority will be given to studies of nitrogen oxides and methane for which natural
and managed systems in the Amazon constitute a significant global source. Second priority
will be given to carbon monoxide, volatile organic carbon compounds and reduced sulfur
gases such as carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide.</p>

<p>Theme 5, dynamics of surface-water chemistry, will focus on the ways in which surface
water chemistry is altered by land-cover and land-use change. Changes in the dynamics of
carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in riparian zones and streams are of particular interest. </p>

Integrated Amazon Study</a></p>
</u>

<p>The development of this Amazon ecological study is being conducted in concert with an
emerging overall, integrated Amazon study to be called the Large-Scale Biosphere -
Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). The Amazon ecological study program will
integrate well with several LBA companion research programs being developed to study other
aspects of the Amazon's environment including its climate system, energy and water
exchange between the land and the atmosphere, surface water hydrology, and atmospheric
chemistry (Figure 1). The plan is to conduct these programs concurrently and to integrate
them to the maximum degree possible through: (1) joint planning of the programs; (2)
sharing of field sites, equipment, and logistical support as much as is possible; (3)
exchange of data; and (4) development of simulation models that couple the key physical,
chemical and biological processes operating at various space and time scales in the Amazon
Basin.</p>

<p>The Amazon ecological study has the potential to interact with the other components of
the integrated LBA study in a variety of ways. The study (components shaded in Figure 1)
will provide </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="../../../../invest/docs/reports/ManausReport/image1.jpg" alt="LBA Integration" width="360" height="495"></p>

<p>information directly to the complementary programs on the energy and water budgets, and
atmospheric chemistry, and indirectly, through the program on energy and water budgets, to
the programs on the climate system and on surface water quantity and flow pathways.
Conversely, the ecological study will require information from all of the other integrated
study program elements, either directly or indirectly.</p>

</b>

<p>The changes in Amazonian vegetation associated with land-use practices exert a large
influence on hydrology, climate, and global biogeochemical cycles (Crutzen and Andreae,
1990; Houghton, 1991; Houghton and Skole, 1990; Salati and Vose, 1984; Shukla et al.,
1990; Nepstad et al., 1994). In the context of the Amazon ecological study, land-use and
land-cover change is a particularly important topic because it encompasses both the
explicit objectives of this Amazonian study and the objectives of Amazonian research
institutions that are concerned chiefly with improvement of agricultural and forestry
production systems. By advancing our knowledge of the rate and spatial pattern of land-use
and land-cover change, and the factors that are driving this change, both global change
questions and regional development questions can be addressed. For both of these purposes,
it is important to improve our quantitative analyses of rates and spatial patterns of
land-cover change, and our predictive understanding of the land-use practices that drive
these changes.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous form of land-use in Amazonia is the conversion of closed-canopy
forests to cattle pasture and agricultural fields. Estimates of the area and rate of this
conversion vary widely, but have shown some convergence in recent years (Figure 1, Table
1). The Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) estimated a total deforested area
of 280,000 km<sup>2</sup> as of 1988, and an average annual rate of 21,000 km<sup>2</sup>
from 1978 to 1988 in Brazilian Amazonia (Fearnside 1993, INPE 1992). Skole and Tucker
(1993) estimated that the total deforested area was 230,000 km<sup>2</sup> in 1988, with
the average annual rate from 1978 to 1988 being about 15,000 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Some important forms of land-use and land-cover change are difficult to measure with
satellite imagery. Selective logging can remove or destroy up to a fourth of the basal
area and half of the canopy cover of Amazonian forests, and greatly increases their
flammability (Uhl and Vieira, 1989; Uhl and Kauffman, 1990), but logging scars become
difficult to detect with satellite imagery shortly after extraction (Lefebvre and Stone,
1994). C. Uhl and A. Veríssimo estimate that logging affects &gt;4,000 km<sup>2</sup> of
forest in Pará State each year. It is also difficult to measure the area that burns each
year, especially those areas of forest that experience ground fires (Setzer and Pereira,
1991). Moreover, in the portion of Amazonia that supports <i>cerrado</i> savanna
vegetation, conversion to agriculture is more difficult to measure with satellite imagery.
This vegetation has been excluded from regional deforestation estimates, even though
government census data indicate that it is being converted to cattle pasture and
agriculture at a faster rate than the closed canopy forests of Amazonia (Klink et al.,
1995).</p>

<p>Although field studies in Amazonia have documented the high frequency of land
abandonment following deforestation, and the generally vigorous regrowth of forests on
abandoned pastures and agricultural sites (Saldarriaga et al., 1988; Uhl et al., 1988;
Nepstad et al., 1991; Salomão, 1994), region-wide estimates of the total area of
abandoned land, the annual rate of abandonment, and the rate at which secondary forests
are converted back to pasture and agriculture are not available. With substantial
ground-truthing, it is possible to distinguish among primary forests, secondary forests,
and shrub-infested fields, </p>

<p>and among different ages of secondary forest using TM imagery (Brown et al., 1992;
Skole, 1994; Moran et al., 1994; Lucas et al., 1993).</p>

<p>An approach to the analysis of land-use and land-cover change in Amazonia could be
developed around a multi-level framework of (a) basin-wide analyses of land-cover change
using fine and coarse resolution satellite remote sensing and region-wide survey
statistics, (b) case studies coupled with intensive measurements at selected locations,
and (c) the development of site-level and basin-level diagnostic and prognostic models.</p>

</b>

<p>This theme of the Amazon ecological study will address four research questions:</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 1</b>: What are the rates and mechanisms of forest conversion to agricultural
land-uses, and what is the relative importance of these land-uses? </p>

<p>This question centers on gaining better estimates of deforestation rates, and a
quantitative understanding of the types of land uses which occur in the Amazon. By knowing
the fraction of all deforestation which results in pasture, for example, it will be
possible to know the relative importance of this land use compared to others when scaling
up from local measurements.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 2</b>: At what rate are converted lands abandoned to secondary forests; what
is the fate of these converted lands, and what are the overall dynamic patterns of land
conversion and abandonment? </p>

<p>The focus of this question is on quantifying the patterns of clearing and abandonment,
accidental burning of secondary vegetation, documenting transition probabilities, and
specifying trajectories of land use after a site is cleared.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 3</b>: What is the area of forest that is affected by selective logging each
year? </p>

<p>The emphasis of this question is on obtaining quantitative estimates of<b> </b>the rate
of forest disturbance by important forms of forest degradation that are difficult to
detect with satellite imagery,<b> </b>focusing on logging and associated fire as the chief
agents of this kind of change.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 4</b>: What are plausible scenarios of future land-cover change in Amazonia? </p>

<p>The focus of this question is to understand the causes and mechanisms of land-cover
change, which provide a basis for establishing how current conditions and trends manifest
themselves over the longer term.</p>

</u>

<p>This theme of the Amazon ecological study will benefit from the large amount of
information that has already been gathered and analyzed from Amazonia. In addition to the
satellite-based maps of deforestation in closed-canopy forests of Amazonia (INPE, 1992;
Skole and Tucker, 1993), the <i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística</i>
(IBGE) and the RADAMBRASIL study have gathered and mapped a large amount of data on the
vegetation types, soils, population demographics, agricultural and forestry activities and
a variety of economic indicators for all of Amazonia. The IBGE recently completed an
analysis of many of these data layers that resulted in an economic-ecological zoning map
of the region (unpublished data). Amazonian research institutions have also conducted a
large number of studies on agricultural and forestry production systems, and the
ecological processes that accompany human utilization of forest and river resources, which
provide an important source of information for the study. The land-use and land-cover
change research theme should attempt to engage and complement these ongoing research
activities. In this way, the Amazon ecological study can help Amazonian institutions
advance toward their research objectives as these institutions improve the quality, the
depth and the long-term impacts of the study.</p>

<p>The land-use and land-cover change theme will support three scales of investigation.
First, Amazonia-wide studies of the rate, location and spatial pattern of deforestation
and forest alteration will be conducted using satellite remote sensing, government
statistics, and survey data. At a second level of analysis, case studies and field
investigations will be carried out in conjunction with multitemporal, high-resolution
satellite data at 1:50,000 to 1;100,000 scale to gain insight into local-scale dynamics of
deforestation, abandonment, and second-growth turnover. These case-study analyses would
use data from census documents and from new surveys to define the parameters that control
local land-use strategies, which would in turn illustrate how changes in land use affects
changes in land cover. Because the causes of deforestation also may significantly relate
to external institutional and economic factors, an elucidation of driving forces cannot be
made with satellite data, surveys, and field studies alone. To develop a predictive model
of land-cover and land-use changes, a third level of analysis will be necessary to define
the external factors and conditions that influence deforestation in the Amazon. </p>

<p>This geographical focus of this study on Amazonia includes substantial areas of cerrado
vegetation in Mato Grosso and Tocantins. Cerrado vegetation is incorporated into other
themes of the study as a vegetation &quot;endmember&quot; situated at the dry end of a
gradient of decreasing rainfall. Although it would certainly be desirable to obtain
information about the cerrado region as a whole (measuring some 2 million km<sup>2</sup>),
this task is beyond the scope of the Amazon ecological study.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 1</b>: What are the rates and mechanisms of forest conversion to agricultural
land-uses, and what is the relative importance of these land-uses? </p>

<p>This question applies to all of Amazonia, and will provide information that drives all
of the analyses of land-use effects on carbon storage, trace gas fluxes, and water use. It
is a question that has been addressed successfully through analysis of Landsat TM
satellite imagery in areas of closed-canopy forest. Rates of forest conversion to pasture
and agricultural fields will be measured through analysis of satellite imagery for all of
Amazonia at several time intervals. This dichotomous, &quot;forest vs. non-forest&quot;
approach to deforestation will be supplemented by other studies designed to determine the
relative contribution of pasture formation and shifting cultivation to measured
deforestation rates. These studies may draw on interviews conducted in specific regions
(e.g. Homma et al., 1993; Mattos and Uhl, 1994), government statistics (e.g. IBGE,
unpublished and Fearnside, 1993), systematic ground-truthing in selected test sites (Skole
et al., 1994; Moran et al., 1994), or other new approaches. This component of the study
depends on the involvement of researchers with field experience in Amazonia, and must
provide an effective system for rapidly disseminating digital map products to researchers
involved in the broader study.</p>

<p>One goal of this study is to include the Amazonian cerrado vegetation in the estimates
of forest conversion. Cerrado has not been included in previous estimates because the
changes in cerrado vegetation through land-use are not as easily detected as the changes
in closed-canopy forest.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 2</b>: At what rate are converted lands abandoned to secondary forests, what
is the fate of these converted lands, and what are the overall dynamic patterns of land
conversion and abandonment? </p>

<p>It has long been realized that land-cover change associated with deforestation is not a
unidirectional process of forest conversion to agriculture. Large areas are abandoned to
secondary growth. In Amazonia as much as 30% of the deforested land is in secondary
growth. This is an important phenomenon that must be captured in analyses of the
land-use/land-cover change process since it determines the correct calculation of net
emissions, and also as it is an important land-use change phenomenon in its own right. The
location and timing of secondary growth is not a simple problem. It will require careful
analysis of the coupling between rates of deforestation and rates of secondary growth
turn-over. The mere existence of a large second growth pool is not itself an indication of
a large carbon sink; consideration must be given to the dynamics associated with this
pool. </p>

<p>In addressing this question, two types of research are needed. Amazonia-wide estimates
of the percentage of cleared land that is in secondary forest are required. With adequate
ground-truthing, this is possible to do using TM imagery in areas of closed-canopy forest.
More intensive case studies of landscape dynamics are needed that determine the age
structure and rates of re-clearing (or accidental burning) of secondary forests, and the
land-use patterns and strategies that are associated with these dynamics. Given the high
degree of regional variation in the floristic composition of secondary forests, the use of
remote sensing in addressing this question requires a large ground survey component. These
intensive, meso-scale studies could shed light on the number of cycles of regrowth that
characterize different Amazonian settings, and would provide an excellent opportunity to
develop a more mechanistic understanding of the factors that limit rates of secondary
forest growth. Previous studies show that secondary forests accumulate biomass at rates
that depend on the intensity of land-use prior to abandonment (Uhl et al., 1988), and that
multiple factors can converge to prevent secondary forest regrowth for many years (Nepstad
et al., in press).</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 3</b>: What is the area of forest that is affected by selective logging each
year?</p>

<p>The area of forest that is affected by selective logging can be estimated through
knowledge of the geographical locations of sawmills, their annual timber production rates,
the amount of timber they harvest per hectare of forest, and the radius from which they
harvest timber. Such an approach could be taken to mapping the areas of timber extraction
for all of Amazonia. This study could be used in conjunction with remote sensing research
to identify methods of mapping and monitoring selective logging practices.</p>

<p>Additional information that is needed for the various forms of selective logging
includes the effect of logging practices on the forest, and the rate at which the remotely
sensed spectral signatures of logged forests are lost through vegetation regrowth in
logging scars. Prediction of future spatial trends in logging may be achieved through
knowledge of forest timber stocks, the quality of road access, and trends in the domestic
and international timber market.</p>

<p>Selective logging also renders closed canopy forests vulnerable to ground fires, which
levels of tree mortality (Uhl and Buschbacher, 1985; Uhl and Kauffman, 1990; Nepstad et
al., 1995). An important goal of this study is, therefore, an analysis of the frequency
and areal extent of these ground fires, and the feasibility of measuring forest fire scars
remotely.</p>

<p>In addition to ground fires, fire return intervals should be determined for non-forest
ecosystems to assess fire effects on carbon flux, hydrology and nutrient export.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 4</b>: What are plausible scenarios of future land-cover change in Amazonia? </p>

<p>This question could be addressed at different scales and by using different approaches.</p>
<i>

<p><a NAME="_Toc333810015"></a><a NAME="_Toc333810670"></a><a NAME="_Toc333982142"></a><a NAME="_Toc333982434"></a><a NAME="_Toc333982727">Scale</a></p>
</i>

<p>Large scale social (e.g. population growth and economic trends) and biophysical (e.g.,
climate change) variables which operate far outside the Amazon influence land-cover change
in the Amazon. For instance, changes in the global economy as well as land tenure in the
South of Brazil dramatically influenced deforestation in the Amazon basin in the late
1980s (Hecht and Cockburn, 1987; Skole et al., 1994), while the depletion of tropical
hardwood stocks in Asia has stimulated logging in Amazonia (Veríssimo et al., 1992). The
frequency of fires in eastern Amazonia may be best predicted by the El Niño Southern
Oscillation events.</p>

<p>However, the driving forces of land use and land-cover change are also found at local
scales. It is the logic employed by the landholder as he/she responds to the constraints
and opportunities presented by the biophysical, political and economic setting that is the
proximate causes of changes in land cover. The scaling of measurements and analyses of
land-use and land-cover change parallels the scaling of analysis by other Themes involving
<i>in-situ</i> measurements at specific sites up through landscape-scale analyses and

</i>

<p>Techniques for monitoring land-use and land-cover change using remote sensing and
geographic information systems have developed rapidly. However, measurement alone will not
provide enough understanding to analyze the driving forces of global change. Thus, linking
observations at a range of spatial and temporal scales to empirical models would provide a
comprehensive approach to understanding the land-cover conversion process and at the same
time provide important inputs to policy. Assessment of the magnitude and ecological
implications of land-cover change is most relevant and useful when it is accompanied by
modeling the linkages between socio-economic configurations and the processes of changes. </p>

<p>The primary utility of models is to provide a systematic approach to understanding a
research problem. An important aspect of the work described here is the link between
direct observations, case studies, and models in an effort to test or identify dominant
features of the land-cover conversion process. The development of diagnostic models can
lead to an improved understanding of system-wide processes of conversion, and at the same
time provide credible, geographically-referenced predictions. </p>

<p>There are at least three classes of models that might be employed in the study,
including those which allow prediction of when (Markov and Logistic), why (Regression) and
where (Spatial statistical) land-cover conversion processes operate. The suite of
empirical models can serve as a foundation upon which mechanistic and systems dynamics
models can be built, the essential feature being the use of direct observations of spatial
phenomena through satellites.</p>

<p>In addition to model development, the prediction of future land-use and land-cover
change is also feasible through analyses of economic sectors. Cost-benefit analysis and
sectoral policy studies can provide insights into the trends of industries such as beef
cattle, perennial agricultural products, timber and minerals. When combined with projected
changes in infrastructure (roads and energy sources), credit programs, regulatory
policies, domestic and international markets, and land reform, predictions can be made
about where and when land-use and land-cover change will take place. </p>

<p>Detailed analyses of the very fine spatial and temporal dynamics of land-use and
land-cover change would be carried out in a few selected locations. Each site would be
approximately 200 km by 200 km, roughly equivalent to the size of a single Landsat scene.
The following selection criteria are used to select the sites: 

<ul>
  <li>locations should represent a gradient of land-use and land-cover change intensity, from
    outright clearing for pasture to degradation for logging.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>locations should provide a gradient of ages of land-use and land-cover change, from new
    frontier areas to areas on long-term settlement</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>locations should be selected which provide a suite of measurements across environmental
    gradients, and include both forest and cerrado</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>locations selected should provide a broad range of size, shape, and patterns of clearing
    and fragmentation of the forest</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>locations selected should include a range of secondary growth dynamics and ages,
    including areas in which the secondary growth is only one or two rotations old and sites
    where the secondary growth is as much as 10 rotations old.</li>

</b>

<p>A measurement program designed to assess the carbon balance in the Amazon Basin should
include assessment of both variability in natural ecosystems and net carbon fluxes
associated with land-use change.</p>

<p>Conversion of natural systems for logging, pasture, or agriculture, and the fate of
these converted lands cause large local transfers of carbon between atmosphere and
ecosystems. Forest conversion in the Amazonia is a net source of carbon to the atmosphere,
while recent Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) measurements indicate that undisturbed forest
systems may be a net carbon sink. The importance of sequestration of carbon in regrowing
forest on abandoned lands is uncertain. Studies are required to determine both the areal
extent of different land uses and the associated changes in carbon. One approach to
determining the flux of carbon over large regions is to track the areal extent of land-use
change and associated changes in carbon stocks (Fearnside, 1992; Houghton et al., 1987;
Houghton, 1991). This approach calculates the net flux of carbon between terrestrial
ecosystems and the atmosphere that results from changes in land use. A related method
relies on comparison of biomass stocks obtained from regional surveys conducted at
different points in time, as has been done in some forests of the temperate zone (Apps and
Kurz, 1994; Birdsey et al., 1993; Kauppi et al., 1992).</p>

<p>A second approach to the regional carbon balance emphasizes the natural carbon cycle,
including net primary production (NPP) and respiration. Fluxes in the natural vegetation
will reflect two processes. The first of these involves metabolic processes of
photosynthesis, growth, and decay, affecting individual trees, and very short time and
spatial scales. The second process, over stand-to-kilometer scales, is succession, which
affects the number, age and species composition of stems, as well as the amount, nature
and turnover rate of soil organic matter. At small scales, eddy-correlation measurement of
CO<sub>2</sub> flux above canopy will integrate both of these processes (metabolic and
successional), while repeated measurements of carbon accumulation in living biomass,
distribution and decomposition of dead biomass, and the nature and turnover of soil
organic matter will allow for partitioning of net flux. Metabolic models based on
fundamental physiological parameters are used to predict regional carbon balance on short
(seasons - decades) timescales. This approach is too crude at present to be able to
resolve net changes in terrestrial carbon stocks that might account for the imbalance in
the global cycle, but it predicts the variations in flux expected as a result of changes
in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (Melillo et al., 1993; Potter et
al., 1993).</p>

<p>While some initial attempts have been made to bring these two approaches (land-use
change and metabolic models) together, it is important to recognize that they require
different types of data and assumptions and have different sources of error. Changes in
carbon storage resulting from human management of the landscape (clearing forests,
logging, cultivation, afforestation) often result in well defined locations of change and
large changes in carbon per hectare. In contrast, changes in carbon storage resulting from
environmental changes in temperature, moisture, and, perhaps, carbon dioxide
concentrations, affect areas of undefined extent, and the accompanying changes in carbon
stocks per hectare may be subtle. While natural disturbances may be considered small
enough to be irrelevant compared to the carbon fluxes associated with land-use changes
(when considered on an areal basis), the integration of smaller fluxes over the larger
total area that remains as natural vegetation implies natural fluxes cannot be ignored in
an Amazonian carbon balance.</p>

<p>Another approach to determining the large scale flux is through direct measurement of
flux. Eddy correlation measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> flux above the forest canopy
integrate stand-level and perhaps successional changes in carbon stocks on time scales
from days to years. When combined with intensive measurements of the flows of C, these
allow development and testing of process models of carbon flow and storage at the stand
level. Aircraft measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> flux provide comparisons of carbon
exchanges between stands and surrounding regions, providing information on both
variability among similar stands and differences among land-cover types.</p>

<p>At larger scales, interpretation of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration patterns around the
basin (using atmospheric tracer models) can be used to deconvolve sources and sinks of
trace gases over very large regions (Enting and Mansbridge, 1991; Tans et al., 1990; Ciais
et al., 1995). Another component of the LBA activity may attempt to derive a basin-wide
estimate of net CO<sub>2</sub> flux. Comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>2</sub>, <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>,
tracers of biomass burning (CO), and other trace gases will provide additional confidence
in such estimates as well as basin-wide fluxes for other trace gas species. This
information will provide a basin-wide test of the ability to predict regional carbon
fluxes from process models coupled to remote sensing and other data layers for the basin.
In particular, estimates of the deliberate (land use) and inadvertent (undisturbed
ecosystem) fluxes should sum to the measured total net flux. If they do, we gain
confidence that we understand the carbon cycle in a major region of the earth. If they do
not, we will have learned something about our techniques and our understanding.</p>

</b>

<p>A major challenge and opportunity of this research study in Amazonia is to determine
both the human management-induced and the climate-induced components of the net flux of
carbon and to compare the results with independent measurement of total net flux for the
entire region. Measurement of flux for the entire Basin will not be a part of the Amazon
ecological study, but may be conducted by the LAMBADA/BATERISTA portion. Carbon is a part
of the nutrient cycle in all ecosystems, thus, questions pertaining to nutrients will be
similar to those of carbon.</p>

<p>Over-arching questions across temporal scales (hours to decades) and spatial scales
(meters to basin level) for the carbon cycle include: 

<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>How large are the carbon pools in vegetation and soils of intact forests, including
      cerrado; pastures; cultivated lands; secondary and logged forests?</li>
    <li>What are the rates of carbon exchange among atmosphere, vegetation, and soils, and how
      are those rates altered by natural and human disturbance?</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>These questions imply a general need to asses carbon pools and fluxes in a variety of
land-cover and land-use types. More specific research questions help focus the research
design:</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 1</b>: What is the seasonal and interannual variability of the CO<sub>2</sub>
flux between the atmosphere and different land-cover/land-use types and from the Amazon
region as a whole? What factors influence the balance of photosynthesis, respiration,
plant recruitment and mortality that give rise to these net fluxes at the ecosystem scale?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 2</b>: What are the relative contributions of fluxes from natural and
disturbed ecosystems to the net basin-wide flux? (To what degree do natural sinks and
sequestration of carbon in regrowing forests balance/offset sources associated with forest
conversion?) </p>

<p>Direct measurements of net ecosystem exchange in terra firme forests suggest that the
natural forest stands studied are net sinks of carbon. These sinks may offset the
increases in carbon release to the atmosphere generally thought to be derived from
deforestation.</p>

<p>Recent improvements in our knowledge of the total area deforested in Amazonia based on
remote sensing studies reveal that this is no longer the major uncertainty in our
understanding of net carbon fluxes from the region. Instead, we need better knowledge of
the rates of forest clearing, the fate of cleared lands, and the management practices
employed in the land uses for the region (see section on land cover and land use). We also
need to improve our knowledge of biomass and soil carbon stocks and their spatial
variability within a vegetation or soil association and across the region. We need
additional information on how forest clearing and subsequent land management practices
affect carbon storages and exchanges. This requires knowledge of rates of biomass decay
and re-growth, the fate of soil organic carbon, and the fate of timber removed from the
forests. Important questions to address for specific land-use/land-cover regimes:</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 3</b>: How do pools and fluxes of carbon and nutrients in soils of
pasture/cropland change over time; what factors (soil properties, management practice)
determine carbon gain or loss? </p>

<p>This question is perhaps most important as a link to trace gas emissions, and a
consequence of changes in other nutrients, because changes in carbon stocks in soils are
generally minor compared to those of vegetation. </p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 4</b>: What are some biologically-mediated influences on carbon sequestration
in abandoned pastures and croplands? </p>

<p>In particular how large are the relative contributions of (1) nutrient depletion and
(2) lack of seed source/live forest roots/invasion limitations (3) extirpation of critical
components of the soil biota (fauna, ants, etc.) that influence nutrient availability,
plant survival and hence, carbon sequestration? </p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 5</b>: How does selective logging change the storage and cycling of carbon in
forests? </p>

<p>This includes influences on microclimate, decomposition, ecosystem structure, and
probability of future disturbances (i.e., fire) that will further influence carbon
dynamics.</p>

<p>Recent data on timber harvest intensity and wood production indicate that selective
logging of otherwise intact stands of forest contributes significantly to the area of
forests altered in Amazonia. Selective logging may result in decreased carbon storage in
living biomass and increased emissions of carbon through decomposition processes for the
region affected. The removal of stemwood to long-term storage pools together with regrowth
following harvest may lead to a net carbon sink. The net flux of carbon from forest end
products needs investigation. There is evidence that logged forests may become more prone
to fire because of the large fine fuel loads left behind and a drier microclimate near the
litter layer. It is difficult to estimate the total area subject to selective logging in
Amazonia, and it is even more difficult to quantify the changes in carbon storage and
emissions.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 6</b>: What factors (land-use history, soil properties, etc.) control the rate
of carbon sequestration in biomass and soils of regrowing forests?</p>

<p>There are major uncertainties in our understanding of the carbon dynamics of re-growing
forests in Amazonia. It has been suggested that secondary forest re-growth following
pasture or crop land abandonment may be responsible for much more carbon accumulation in
Amazonia than previously estimated. This suggestion needs to be investigated. There is
also evidence in some regions that secondary forests are cleared and re-converted to
agriculture after only a few years of re-growth. Thus, better information on the ages of
secondary forests and the rates of carbon accumulation at various ages is desired.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 7</b>: What portion of the basin-wide flux of CO<sub>2</sub> is from fire? How
do ecosystems recover from fire? Are there statistical relationships between fire
occurrence/frequency and land management (e.g., selective logging)? </p>

<p>Some management practices include fire as a way of concentrating nutrients in available
soil pools. Other practices, such as selective logging, may increase the flammability of
forests and affect fire frequency. Field measurement of carbon emissions from active fires
is probably not necessary to address this question, and thus, is not a major focus for
this research program.</p>

</b>

<p>We need additional measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes in vegetation and soil of
primary forests, as well as selectively logged forests, pastures, agricultural lands and
secondary growth forests of known ages and management histories at a number of locations
throughout the Amazon Basin and especially in regions of rapid land-use change (i.e.,
Pará and Rondônia). Since these data are difficult to obtain, it will be important to
identify the greatest uncertainties and largest gaps in our present knowledge base and
then establish priorities for new measurements. Many sites may exist where a partial data
set has been obtained (such as above-ground biomass), that may be augmented through
addition of below-ground, or standing dead biomass estimates. The sites should be
distributed across climate and fertility (soil-type) gradients, as well as by age or time
since last major land-use change (for pastures and regrowing forests). Indirect methods to
determine the biomass and associated factors such as leaf area index (LAI) should be
tested and calibrated around these sites. Remote-sensing approaches should be used to
extend biomass data sets, though these methods need to be better tested and quantified.</p>

<p>Task 1. Improved estimates of biomass in different land-cover types</p>

<p>We envision the need to for a suite of sites at which carbon stocks are measured along
regional gradients of climate (specifically seasonality of precipitation) and soil type
(as identified by nutrient status). The level of detail of measurement among sites should
be stratified, with some sites used for calibration, some as checks on estimates based on
remote sensing or mapping techniques. We envision the need for at least three levels of
sampling intensity: 

<ol>
  <ol TYPE="1" START="1">
    <li>Primary calibration sites, where destructive sampling of biomass is used to develop
      allometric equations relating root biomass, rooting depth, LAI, to factors such as stem
      diameter, local soil and climate characteristics.</li>
    <li>Sites to be revisited annually (or more frequently) to study growth rates of trees,
      changes in species composition, stem distribution, standing and fallen trees to
      investigate gap dynamics over at least a 4-5 year period. A full suite of measurements may
      include: above- and below-ground biomass, rooting depth, LAI (with determination of
      allometric relations to predict below-ground biomass and LAI from above-ground
      characteristics), diameter-increment-based measure of growth rate, litterfall, estimates
      of root turnover, canopy phenology, decomposition rate of litter, root detritus and large
      woody debris (logs). Soil parameters could include bulk density, carbon and nutrient
      content, partitioning of soil organic matter among labile and refractory components, soil
      texture and particle size, CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes using chamber techniques, etc. Some of
      these intensive sites should coincide with tower measurements of NEE, but they should not
      be limited only to those areas with towers. These sites should overlap with sites
      identified for Task 2 (below). </li>
    <li>Sites to be used to check estimates of biomass based on remote sensing techniques.
      Biomass estimates based on mapping of soil and land-cover properties, as well as Radar
      techniques need to be tested. Observations could be much more limited at these sites.
      (Includes further analysis of RADAM data sets from carbon perspective).</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Task 2. Improved understanding of the dynamics of carbon change with
land-use/management</p>

<p>Dynamics of carbon accumulation/loss in biomass and soils in managed pasture and
regrowing systems may be assessed by careful selection of sites along chronosequences such
as pasture age, or time since a change in management practice. These sites should be
carefully chosen to reflect the most important land-use/land-cover changes in a given
region (e.g., selective logging and pasture abandonment in eastern Amazonia, fire or
cultivation in cerrado). There is a need to quantify pools and dynamics in all three
distinct phases of the land-use gradient, including undisturbed systems, the exploitation
phase (when changes may be particularly rapid), and the recovery phase. It will be
important to design sampling sites to investigate the following questions in particular:

    <li>effects of fertilization, land-use history (intensity), management, soil physical and

</ol>

<p>Soil carbon stock changes following disturbance such as deforestation are small
compared to accompanying biomass changes, but much of the fast-cycling carbon in these
ecosystems may reside in the soil organic matter. Studies of soil carbon should thus focus
on its dynamics and turnover rate and relation to nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and
interannual variability in carbon sequestration and release in ecosystems. Soil
measurements should include measurements of carbon stock, an assessment of how much of
that organic matter is in labile and refractory pools, and CO<sub>2</sub> flux (perhaps at
a subset of sites?). Tools to use include isotopic methods (<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C),
rate of change following disturbance, decomposition studies, and related models.</p>

<p>At a subset of the sites used to study carbon dynamics, it will be important to measure
the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) either continuously or over significant portions of
several growing seasons using tower eddy correlation to determine if these ecosystems are
accumulating carbon. Tower sites should coincide with one point along a time or management
gradient. The NEE measurements will be important as an overall test of models of carbon
sequestering or loss from vegetation and soils developed from chronosequences and gradient
sampling. At these sites, measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes will be similar to
those outlined for intensive sites (above), but additional measurements will be needed to
determine higher frequency fluxes between vegetation, soils and atmosphere. In addition to
the set of climatic and radiation parameters measured at the towers, the following should
be given serious consideration for frequent or continuous measurement: soil water content;
CO<sub>2</sub> respiration from soil, stems, boles, roots(?); vegetation photosynthesis
and respiration in response to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and other
variables; leaf area index and phenology; litterfall; and root turnover (?). Ground
surveys of live/dead vegetation in the flux tower footprint, and vertical profiles of
foliar nutrient content (including lignin) should be conducted seasonally or annually.
Such measurements would be useful for partitioning the observed NEE among components of
the carbon transfers between soil, live and dead vegetation and atmosphere within the
tower footprint, and determining the factors controlling the variability in overall carbon
flux. Estimates of net primary production (NPP) could be made at these sites from the data
gathered and used to calibrate AVHRR/NDVI based measures of primary productivity.</p>

<p>Task 3. Understanding causes of seasonal and interannual variability in natural systems</p>

<p>An important part of the overall LBA activity includes assessment of how the natural
vegetation interacts with global climate and carbon budgets. As part of this effort,
towers should be located in primary vegetation along a gradient in climate and soil
properties across the basin. Tower deployments should be long enough to capture
year-to-year variability in NEE (and its relation to climate). Ancillary measurements at
these tower sites must include those expressed above in order to develop a process-based
understanding of interannual carbon storage changes at each site. Locating towers along
climate gradients will allow important understanding of how the fluxes of carbon vary with
moisture, temperature, soil nutrient status.

    <p>Task 4. Scaling up to region and basin-wide estimates of net carbon exchange (for
    comparison with basin-wide measurements carried out by the other components of LBA).</p>

<p>Information gathered during Tasks 1,2, and 3 will be used to parameterize and test
process-based models of carbon exchange. These models when combined with GIS/remote
sensing information on the spatial distribution of land cover/soil properties and climatic
variables, will provide estimates of regional and basin-wide fluxes of carbon that may be
compared to aircraft eddy flux measurements and basin scale carbon balance estimates from
other LBA components. </p>

</b>

<p>The flows of energy, water, and carbon within ecosystems of Amazonia are intimately
linked with the cycling of essential plant nutrients. Hence, the ways in which changes in
land use and land cover affect carbon stocks, trace gas emissions and surface water
chemistry are mediated by perturbations in nutrient cycles. An experimental design for
studying effects of land conversions must include consideration of natural distributions
of stocks of nutrients within forest ecosystems, the processes that determine flows of
nutrients, and how land conversion affects those stocks and flows.</p>

<p>Human alteration of natural ecosystems and their conversion to different agricultural
uses changes the storage of nutrients and rates of organic matter and nutrient cycling.
Some important examples of how these actions alter carbon and nutrient flows include the
direct volatilization of carbon and nitrogen stocks formerly in the vegetation caused by
biomass burning (Ewel et al., 1981; Fearnside, 1993; Kauffman et al., in press), increases
of soil stocks of elements such as P, K, Ca and Mg after burning as these elements are
transferred from pools formerly in the vegetation (Nye and Greenland, 1964; Sanchez, 1976;
Uhl and Jordan, 1984; Kauffman et al., in press), and removal of stocks of nutrients such
as Ca, Mg, P and N in logging operations. Other changes include alterations to the amount
of carbon and nutrients stored in the soils converted to pasture or other agricultural
uses and changes to nutrient cycling rates (Montagnini and Buschbacher, 1989; Choné et
al., 1991; Nepstad et al., 1995; Neill et al., 1995; Moraes et al., in press). These
changes are linked to soil fertility, which in turn affects future changes to land use and
land cover. Changes to trace gas emissions are often closely associated with changes to
soil nutrient cycling patterns in these non-forest systems. (Luizão et al., 1989; Keller
et al., 1989). Further modifications to nutrient cycling patterns can occur over time
under altered land use, such as when pastures age or degrade (Buschbacher et al., 1988;
Robertson and Tiedje, 1988). These changes can influence ecosystem responses, such as the
rate at which forests regrow, which are tied to other components of the Amazon study, such
as carbon sequestration by regrowing vegetation and the transport and processing of
nutrients to downstream aquatic ecosystems. The Manaus workshop synthesis paper (Fernandes
et al., manuscript) provides additional background on the effects of land-use change on
nutrient cycling in Amazonia.</p>

<p>Study of the effects of land-cover and land-use change on nutrient cycling as part of
this science plan will be focused the changes that are dominant in terms of area in the
Amazon. Although better estimates of the relative importance of various types of forest
conversion are expected to result from this campaign, decisions must be made now with
existing data and field experience regarding the most important types of changes that we
believe are worthy of study of nutrient dynamics. Studies should focus on understanding
changes to nutrient dynamics in the following situations, all originating with intact
Amazon forest:<b> 

<ul>
  </b>
  <li>Direct conversion of forest to pasture. Typically practiced on large ranches (&gt;1000
    ha)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Selective logging: This often occurs on lands held by large holders, although small
    holders also sell logs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Slash and burn agriculture. This is typically conducted by small land holders (&lt;100
    ha). The sequence of management phases varies regionally; but one common pattern is:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <p>forest ----&gt; slash/burn ----&gt; crop ----&gt; fallow ----&gt; slash/burn ----&gt;
  crop ----&gt; pasture</p>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Pasture degradation and abandonment. This occurs on small farms and large ranches.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Conversion of cerrado to pasture and row crop agriculture. These increasingly important
    changes are concentrated in the southern portion of the region.</li>

<p>QUESTION 1</b>: How do the stocks, cycling rates and budgets of carbon and important
elements N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Al change under the different land covers and land uses?</p>

<p>Unlike the relatively large database that exists for nutrient budgets in temperate
ecosystems of North America and Europe, data on nutrient budgets for tropical ecosystems
in general, and for Amazonia in particular, are very few. This information is important
for understanding controls on plant productivity and ultimately carbon storage in natural
and agricultural systems. Information on nutrient budgets in intact and altered forest is
essential to an understanding of how land-use change alters material transfers between
terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere and between terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic
ecosystems.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 2:</b> How is pasture productivity and the duration of the period of
productive pasture use related to the availability of P or other soil nutrients?</p>

<p>Good estimates of carbon budgets require knowledge of the fate of converted land,
including how long it stays in pasture. Pasture soils can gain carbon if they remain
productive and they can lose carbon if they become unproductive. While there are many
factors that affect pasture productivity, several studies (Toledo and Serrão, 1982;
Gonçalves and Loiveira, 1984; Falesi, 1976) and the use of P fertilizer by some ranchers
suggest that P is one of the primary limiting factors. Research on this question should
aim to develop predictive capabilities of the probably length of the pasture phase given
information on soil properties, climate, and management practices. In addition to the
objective of improving budgeting of carbon stocks, this effort has obvious practical
implications for sustainable development and should be of interest to local ranchers.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 3</b>: What are the major factors that control the rates of regrowth and
carbon accumulation in abandoned pastures and regrowing secondary forests?</p>

<p>Rates of secondary regrowth are important for calculations of carbon budgets and water
balance, trace gas emissions, and leaching of nutrients to ground and surface water.
Controls of forest regrowth are poorly understood, but may be related to soil stocks of
nutrients and organic matter, the size of pasture clearing, and hence the distance to the
nearest seed source, the presence of sprouts from live tree roots that have survived the
pasture phase, or other biotic factors, such as the presence of earthworms and cutter
ants, or microorganisms such as mycorrhizae (Nepstad et al., 1991; Nepstad et al., in
press). Understanding controls on forest regrowth is important for predicting regrowth
from different land covers and land uses.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 4</b>: How does the capability of native vegetation to extract nutrients from
soil differ from the capabilities of exotic pasture grasses?</p>

<p>Native and non-native plant species can have very different nutrient requirements and
different influences on patterns of ecosystem nutrient cycling. Native vegetation may
obtain &quot;less available&quot; forms of nutrients or an ability to exploit a greater
soil volume or depth to obtain nutrients. Differences in nutrient cycling between native
forest and planted pastures have implications for the longevity of pastures and the rate
of regrowth of forests, both of which are important controls on ecosystem carbon stocks.
It is also important to develop an understanding of how tests of soil nutrient status,
developed primarily to aid management of agroecosystems, may or may not be transferable to
management of native forest species. </p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION</b> <b>5</b>: How does the intensity of selective logging influence forest
soil moisture, microbial process related to decomposition, and the release of nutrients,
thus altering forest regrowth and flammability?</p>

<p>Selective logging alters ecosystem structure, ecosystem water budgets, and nutrient
cycling patterns (Uhl and Kauffman, 1984; Uhl and Vieira, 1989). Up to a point, as logging
intensity increases, canopy interception and evapotranspiration of water decrease and soil
moisture increases. This in turn affects a suite of faunal and microbial activities in the
soil that are related to decomposition. However, as logging intensity increases,
sub-canopy humidity decreases, resulting in drier litter and greater risk of flammability.
These changes affect forest regrowth and forest flammability, both of which are critical
for understanding ecosystem carbon balance.</p>

</b>

<p>This plan calls for field measurements of nutrient stocks and cycling rates at specific
sites designed to answer the five questions outlined above. These measurements should be
focused in natural forest and in areas that fall into the major categories of human-driven
land-use and land-cover change now occurring in Amazonia (as stated in the introduction:
forest conversion directly to pasture, selective logging, slash and burn agriculture,
pasture degradation and abandonment). Because of the important role nutrient cycling plays
in controlling ecosystem carbon accumulation, trace gas fluxes and land-water transfers,
measurements of nutrient dynamics should be coordinated with the carbon, trace gas and
surface water chemistry components of the Amazon Basin study <i>to the maximum extent
practicable.</i> </p>

<p>Gradients of climate and soil type are two additional factors that must be carefully
considered in the approach and site selection for examination of nutrient cycling as part
of the Amazon study. The most important climatic gradient that affects soils, vegetation,
and nutrient cycles is the severity of the dry season, which ranges from virtually no dry
season in the northwest Amazon to a dry season of six months or more in transition to the
cerrado region of the southeast. Closed moist evergreen forest extends across a large part
of this gradient, so that about half of the forested region experiences three months or
more when evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, and significant water uptake from
soils is needed to maintain an evergreen canopy. This same gradient is apparent in a map
of soil moisture regimes, with perudic regimes mapped in the northwest, the udic regime in
the middle part of the Amazon, and the ustic regime mapped in a arc along the eastern and
southern boarders of the basin.</p>

<p>Soils also vary across the Amazon (Cochrane and Sanchez, 1982; Richter and Babbar,
1991). Variation in parent material (i.e., geologic formations) is mostly independent of
current climatic patterns. Broadly speaking, there is a preponderance of dystrophic (low
base status) soils in Pará and Amazonas and a greater relative area of eutrophic (high
base status) soils in Rondônia, but eutrophic and dystrophic soils can be found in all
regions. Soil texture (sand, silt, and clay) also varies at both basin-wide and local
scales. Soil texture affects many processes, including plant-available-water holding
capacity, diffusivity of gases, hydraulic conductivity, and sequestration of soil carbon.
A large proportion of Amazonian soils are classified as either oxisols or ultisols,
according to USDA Soil Taxonomy (Moraes et al., 1995). In very broad terms, much of the
area of the finest textured (high clay) soils are oxisols and many soils with lower clay
contents are ultisols, but the distinction between these soil orders is not always
particularly useful for stratifying soils by texture or base status. Distinction between
soil textures and between eutrophic and dystrophic soils should not be viewed as a
dichotomy, but rather as a continuum. Both the US and Brazilian soil classification
systems contain information on base status at intermediate levels in the hierarchical
classification systems. However, it must be emphasized that the RADAM soil map at
1:1,000,000 provides only a coarse-scale summary of the dominant soil types within an
area, and that each map unit contains &quot;inclusions&quot; of soils that differ from the
type for which the map unit is named. There is no substitute or acceptable short cut for
field and laboratory analysis of soils when candidate research sites are being considered.</p>

<p>Selection of specific sites for field measurements of nutrient cycling should
incorporate climatic variation from perennially wet to a strong dry season that lasts up
to six months. Special attention should be paid to controlling for the variability of soil
types in selected sites. The criteria of soil texture (high clay, low clay) and soil base
status (high base saturation, low base saturation) should be used to stratify multiple
sites within a climatic regime. Particular effort should be made to restrict the most
inclusive and intensive nutrient cycling study sites to locations that fall on the oxisol
and ultisol soil types that cover the majority of the Amazon.

  </u>
</ul>

<p>Below we outline potential study approaches to specific questions. This list is not
intended to be exhaustive or to discourage other field and experimental approaches.
Rather, these approaches are presented as ideas for ways in which the effects of forest
conversion on nutrient cycles can be addressed in light of other studies of carbon stocks,
trace gas emissions, and surface water chemistry that are part of the Amazon study.</p>
<b>

<p>Question 1. </b>How do the stocks, cycling rates and budgets of carbon and important
elements N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Al change under the different land covers and land uses?
These changes to nutrient cycling can be addressed in native forest and in adjacent
altered sites. Certain basic measurements are essential. These should include total stocks
of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, and carbon in soils and vegetation. The effort for measuring
nutrient pools in vegetation should be coordinated with estimates of biomass. The topsoil
should be sampled in relatively small increments (e.g., 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm), as
concentrations may change rapidly with depth. Deep soil should also be considered as a
potential source of nutrients, so that nutrient stocks should also be measured at depths
&gt;2m if possible. Stocks of nutrients in harvested materials (logs, crops, cattle)
should also be measured where appropriate, as well as losses resulting from use of fire.
Bulk density and soil texture also must be measured by depth increment to convert measures
of concentrations of soil carbon and soil nutrients to total stocks. The accuracy of bulk
density measurements is equally important as the accuracy of nutrient concentrations.</p>

<p>Indices of &quot;available&quot; nutrients may be particularly useful for studies of
pasture and crop productivity and for studies of trace gas emissions. Suggested methods
include: 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <ol TYPE="a">
    <li>ammonium acetate (pH 7) for cations and ECEC</li>
    <li>1N KCl for extractable Al and for pH</li>
    <li>Mehlich I extraction for available P</li>
    <li>7-day aerobic incubation for net N mineralization and net nitrification</li>
    <li>fumigation and 0.5 M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for microbial biomass C, N, and P</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Methods outlined in the Tropical Soil Biology Fertility Program (Anderson and Ingram,
1989) provide guidance on these methods. Atmospheric inputs of nutrients (especially dry
deposition), are important as a potential source of essential plant nutrients. Frequent
collections to obtain fresh samples are necessary to obtain reliable data but these are
difficult to obtain. Throughfall and litterfall are among the most readily measured flows
of nutrients within ecosystems. Ratios of nutrients within these flows provide indications
of the relative abundance of nutrients, and the absolute amounts indicate rates of
nutrient cycling.</p>
<b>

<p>Question 2. </b>How is pasture productivity and the duration of the period of
productive pasture use related to the availability of P or other soil nutrients? The role
of P or other nutrients in controlling pasture productivity may be addressed with
chronosequences and with P and other amendments. As cattle pastures are widespread, these
experiments should be conducted across the climate gradient of the region and across
gradients of soil base status and soil texture. The duration of the productive pasture
phase is a function of P availability. Possible confounding factors are the degree of
biomass removal during pasture formation, burning, relocation of nutrients resulting from
rotating cattle among pastures, and grazing intensity.</p>
<b>

<p>Question 3. </b>What are the major factors that control the rates of regrowth and
carbon accumulation in abandoned pastures and regrowing secondary forests? Nutrient
cycling control of forest regrowth may be addressed by studies along gradients of soil
organic matter and soil fertility and by amendments. The role of seed sources could be
addressed by comparing regrowing forest plots differing distances from existing forest, or
by experimental manipulation of seed densities. The effects of stump sprouts could be
examined by mechanical or herbicide removal of tree rootstocks. Soil fauna effects could
be addressed by assessments of faunal and microbial populations and activities.</p>
<b>

<p>Question 4.</b> How does the capability of native vegetation to extract nutrients from
soil differ from the capabilities of exotic pasture grasses? The role of native compared
with exotic vegetation can be addressed with mass balance studies, pot studies, tracers,
and studies of mychorrizal associations. This should be tested in both dystrophic and
eutrophic soils because of differences in nutrient availability, and it should be tested
across a climate gradient where rooting depth may also vary.</p>

<p>Question 5.</b> How does the intensity of selective logging influence forest soil
moisture, microbial process related to decomposition, and the release of nutrients, thus
altering forest regrowth and flammability? The effects of selective logging need to be
tested in both dystrophic and eutrophic soils because the degree of nutrient availability
may determine whether release of nutrients from decomposition is an important factor in
regrowth of the logged forest. A study could address the interactions of microclimate and
faunal and microbial processes, with logging intensity providing the variation in
microclimate within a forest. A climate gradient across the region is needed because
flammability of the forest may be a serious risk only within the ustic moisture regime.
Variations in logging intensity could form the basis for an experimental design.

<p>The product from this activity will be a greatly expanded process-level understanding
of nutrient cycles and budgets under different land covers and land uses. It will produce
a database that will provide an important basis for understanding land-atmosphere and
land-water connections in the larger Amazon Basin study.</p>

<p>This information will also be critical for the following cross-cutting issues:

</ul>

<p>Forest conversion that decreases evapotranspiration probably causes increases in
runoff, which provides a mechanism for potential leaching of nutrients through the soil
profile and loss of nutrients in particulate matter eroded from the soil surface. However,
nutrient cycling processes (including decomposition, microbial immobilization, rooting
depth, plant nutrient uptake, and fertilization) also affect the potential for nutrient
losses from terrestrial ecosystems and inputs to aquatic systems via leaching and erosion.
Hence the flow of water through the landscape must be integrated with the cycling of
nutrients in order to understand the exchanges of nutrients between terrestrial and
aquatic components of the landscape. This linkage will require interdisciplinary
collaboration.</p>

</u>

<p>Trace gas emissions are also obviously linked to cycling of nutrients, particularly
nitrogen. Forest conversion and management of croplands and pasture lands affect both
nutrient cycling and diffusivity of gases within the soil. Decreases in evapotranspiration
(ET) can result in increased soil water storage, decreased gaseous diffusivity, and
decreased redox potential, which has important implications for the species of N trace gas
emitted from the soil and the balance between methane production and consumption within
the soil. Cattle grazing and other practices that alter bulk density and porosity also
affect gaseous diffusivity. Hence, studies of nutrient cycling must be integrated with
studies of physical processes of water movement and gaseous diffusivity.</p>

</u>

<p>Studies of nutrient cycling are directly connected to studies of carbon accumulation in
plant biomass because soil fertility can directly influence plant growth. Indirectly,
nutrient cycling may influence land uses, such as the time land is used as productive
pasture, or the time land spends as regrowing forest before it re-enters agricultural
production. A better understanding of nutrient dynamics in different land cover and land
uses will greatly improve our understanding of carbon accumulation and the forces driving
land-use change.</p>

</u>

<p>The most widely used biogeochemical models (e.g., CENTURY, CASA, TEM) link carbon
cycles with C:N ratios and lignin contents of various compartments of vegetation and
soils. New models might also be developed, but it is likely that carbon cycles and budgets
will be linked to nutrients, including P, in nearly all such models. Modeling is a
powerful tool for interpolating and extrapolating as well as for testing our understanding
of the modeled linkages of processes within the ecosystem and among ecosystems in a
landscape. Hence, studies of nutrient dynamics should be coordinated with the needs of
models for input data and validation data of existing models and perhaps for development
of new models.</p>

</b>

<p>The forests and wetlands of the Amazonia represent the largest single extent of
tropical forest globally (7 x 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>). These forests play an
important role in the earth's energy and biogeochemical budgets (Dickinson 1987). Upland
soils, wetlands soils/sediments, and vegetation all emit significant quantities of trace
gases. These three functional sources have different controls that may be altered by the
process of land-use change. Starting in the late 1960's large areas of forests have been
cleared and converted to shifting agriculture, cattle pastures, and permanent crops.
Selective timber extraction has changed the structure and composition of substantial
forested areas particularly in eastern Pará, and along river courses. These activities
have the potential to alter the exchanges of trace gases between the ecosystems of the
Amazon and the atmosphere. Trace gases of interest include those that are primarily
important to the radiative properties of the troposphere such as nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)
and the reduced sulfur gases (e.g. COS, CS<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, DMS, etc.), those
which regulate oxidant balance such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen
dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) (NO + NO<sub>2</sub> = NO<sub>x</sub>), and volatile organic
carbon gases (VOC) (Fehsenfeld et al., 1992), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) which has both
functions. We include the effects of natural ecosystems in this plan and emphasize the
perturbations brought about by human development efforts.</p>

<p>Of all land-use changes in Amazonia, conversion of forest to cattle pasture has been
the most obvious and the most publicized. Based on research in Brazil and in other
tropical forest areas, we know that this conversion has potentially large effects on
soil-atmosphere trace gas emissions. In the case of upland soils, gas transport, ecosystem
productivity, and rates of nutrient cycling exert the strongest controls over trace gas
production and emission. The conversion of a forest to cattle pasture results in soil
compaction and limited drainage. This in turn limits gas diffusion which may reduce the
consumption of methane or increase the production of nitrous oxide by denitrification. </p>

<p>Measurements of soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions made in the Brazilian Amazon and in other
tropical areas indicate that tropical forest soils are a major global source for this
greenhouse gas (Keller and Matson, 1994). Tropical forests probably account for 3 Tg N<sub>2</sub>O-N
of a total global budget of approximately 14 Tg-N (Matson and Vitousek, 1990). Limited
observations from the Amazon region raise some interesting hypotheses: 1) disturbance may
greatly increase N<sub>2</sub>O emissions; 2) N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from clay soils are
greater than from sandy soils while the opposite is true for NO; and 3) for moist forest
areas, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions are greatest in the wet season and NO emissions are
greatest in the dry season.</p>

<p>Luizão et al. (1989) found that on an annual basis, emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O from
pastures exceeded forest emissions by a factor of 3. They suggested that conversion of
tropical forest to pasture may account for as much as 1 Tg N<sub>2</sub>O-N annually,
about 25% of the current imbalance of N<sub>2</sub>O sources over sinks. Subsequent work
by Keller et al. (1993) in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica shows that this estimate is
probably an upper bound. Keller et al. found that soils of cattle pastures recently
established after clearing and burning tropical forest emitted 5 to 8 times as much N<sub>2</sub>O
as forest soils for about 10 years following deforestation. After a decade of pasture use
without fertilizer inputs, soil-atmosphere fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O and NO from pastures
fell below the levels found from forest soils.</p>

<p>The existing database for soil NO emissions is far more limited than that for N<sub>2</sub>O.
While large N<sub>2</sub>O emissions appear more closely linked to denitrification in
soils, evidence is building that NO emissions are more closely linked to nitrification
(Davidson, et al. 1993). As a result, NO emissions are favored under drier conditions than
N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Like N<sub>2</sub>O, NO emissions appear to peak within a decade
following deforestation and pasture conversion at the lowland Costa Rican wet forest site.
NO emissions fall to very low levels in older pastures.</p>

<p>Globally, natural wetlands produce approximately 110 Tg y-1 of, roughly 60% in the
tropics (Fung et al., 1991; Bartlett and Harriss, 1993). Devol et al. (1990) estimate that
the main-stem floodplain of the Amazon River alone may account for 5-10 Tg y<sup>-1</sup>
CH<sub>4</sub>. Amazon-wide estimates are hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding
wetland areas and distribution of ecosystem types as well as a dearth of studies of
wetlands off the main stem of the Amazon River. Methane emissions from the main-stem
floodplain of the Amazon River have been reviewed by Bartlett and Harriss (1993). On
average, the largest methane emissions (202 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1 </sup>) were found
over floating mats of macrophytes. Methane emissions were generally smaller in flooded
forest (100 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1 </sup>) and open water habitats (49 mg m<sup>-2</sup>
d<sup>-1 </sup>). Bubbling generally accounted for more than 2/3 of the measured methane
flux (Crill et al., 1988; Devol et al., 1990). </p>

<p>Despite considerable study of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in the Amazon Basin, large
uncertainties exist in estimates of regional flux. Habitat types have been classified only
for very limited areas and only for the river's main stem. Fluxes, inundated areas, and
inundation periods are not well known outside of the main stem. We have no
process-oriented model for translating ecosystem properties (e.g. productivity) to methane
emissions although research in sub-tropical wetlands suggests that this is a promising
direction (Whiting et al., 1991).</p>

<p>Numerous investigations show that most well-aerated soils consume methane from the
atmosphere through microbial processes (Reeburgh et al., 1993). Diffusion is the limiting
factor for methane consumption in many soils (Born et al., 1991). Methane consumption by
forest soils of the Amazon Basin was first reported by Keller et al. (1983). This report
was confirmed by studies in several tropical forest sites (Keller et al., 1986; Goreau and
de Mello, 1988; Keller et al., 1990; Delmas et al., 1992; Keller et al., 1993; Keller and
Reiners, 1994). Methane consumption rates for tropical forests soils generally average
about 1-2 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Goreau and de Mello (1988)
found that conversion of forest outside of Manaus to cattle pasture resulted in a
diminution of this methane sink. Soil compaction by cattle leading to poor soil aeration
changes the balance between methane consumers and producers. In poorly drained soils
methane production may become important. Studies in Rondônia show that conversion of
forest to cattle pasture can change a net methane sink to a small net methane source (~ 1
mg m<sup>-2 </sup>d<sup>-1 </sup>) (Steudler et al., submitted). This confirms findings
for tropical forest and pasture sites in Costa Rica (Keller et al., 1993). Steudler et al.
(submitted) point out that biomass burning for land clearing and cattle themselves have a
greater effect on the methane accounting for forest to pasture conversion than the balance
of soil sources and sinks.</p>

<p>CO may be produced and consumed in soils. CO consumption by soils is microbially
regulated (Seiler and Conrad, 1987). Although we lack definitive evidence, we would expect
soil CO consumption to be limited by diffusion as in the case of CH<sub>4</sub>. There are
2 pathways for CO production in soils and vegetation, thermal and photochemical
decomposition of organic matter (Conrad and Seiler, 1985; Zepp et al., submitted). These
pathways may be simply differentiated in the field by alternate use of light (transparent)
and dark (opaque) flux chambers. Preliminary measurements in wet sub-tropical forests in
Puerto Rico indicate that forests soils are a weak CO sink (~10<sup>10</sup> molecules cm<sup>-2</sup>
s<sup>-1 </sup>). In comparison, adjacent pasture soils and surface grass vegetation
emitted CO (~10<sup>11</sup> molecules cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1 </sup>) when exposed to
sunlight (Tarr and Keller, unpublished data).</p>

<p>One of the surprising results of the NASA and INPE sponsored Amazon Boundary Layer
Expeditions (ABLE-2) of the 1980's was the inference of a strong CO source, 4 x 10<sup>11</sup>
molecules cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, in tropical forests based on measurements of
boundary layer CO concentrations in tropical forest (Kirchhoff and Marinho 1990). This CO
source cannot be explained by hydrocarbon oxidation in the model of Jacob and Wofsy
(1990). This model may not appropriately account for all hydrocarbon emissions and
reactions leading to CO production. However, it is likely that direct emission of CO from
vegetation accounts for at least part of the inferred source.</p>

<p>Terrestrial vegetation is the largest global source of volatile organic carbon (VOC)
compounds to the atmosphere exceeding by a factor of 2-3 industrial processes (Müller,
1992). These compounds regulate atmospheric oxidants at regional and global levels, and
produce organic acids that contribute to acidic deposition in remote areas (Fehsenfeld et
al., 1992). Through condensation reactions, VOC may be an important source of
cloud-condensation-nuclei (CCN) which affect cloud formation and droplet size, hence
optical properties. Isoprene and the monoterpene compounds have been investigated most
extensively. Emissions vary significantly among species. Within species, emissions of
isoprene are dependent primarily on light and temperature while monoterpene emissions may
be accurately predicted from leaf concentrations and temperature (Guenther et al., 1991).
Predicting leaf concentrations of monoterpenes for a given species depends upon a variety
of factors including site quality, plant phenology, and herbivory. Both temperature and
light intensity are higher in the tropics versus the temperate and boreal zones.
Accordingly tropical emissions probably account for more than half of global emissions of
isoprene (Rasmussen and Khalil 1988).</p>

<p>Investigation of the vegetation emissions of VOC to the atmosphere in the tropics has
been exceedingly limited. Data collected as part of the Brazilian-American Amazon Boundary
Layer Expedition (ABLE-2A) in forest outside Manaus, Brazil, may be the only measurements
of VOC emissions that permit area flux estimation. Based on data collected at the ABLE
experimental sites, isoprene emissions are estimated in the range of 25 to 38 mg m<sup>-2</sup>
d<sup>-1</sup> and monoterpenes at about 6 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (Zimmerman et
al., 1988; Jacob and Wofsy, 1988). No published data are available at the level of
individual plant species from the Amazon region.</p>

<p>The global source strength of OCS is about 13.8-28.5 Gmol S y<sup>-1</sup>, of which
30% is estimated to be from CS2 oxidation by tropospheric OH, 28% from the oceans, 24%
from soils and marshes and 12% from biomass burning (Chin and Davis, 1993). Carbonyl
sulfide has not been investigated in the troposphere over the Amazon basin; neither have
OCS fluxes been determined for soil surfaces nor at canopy level in the Amazon forest. In
laboratory experiments Goldan et al. (1988) found light-dependent OCS absorption by
plants. Enclosure studies in other ecosystems suggest that vegetation and soils may be a
sink for OCS (Hines and Morrison, 1992; de Mello and Hines, 1994; Castro and Galloway
1991; Fried et al., 1993). However, high OCS concentrations transported from areas of
biomass burning complicate the interpretation of the vertical profile data. Given the
extent of vegetation cover in the Amazon, we think that the potential for OCS deposition
should be investigated. </p>

</b>

<p>The questions we pose are grouped into 2 priorities. We assign highest priority to
studies of nitrogen oxides, and CH<sub>4</sub> for which the natural and managed systems
of the Amazon Basin constitute a significant global source. We have strong evidence that
modification of the natural Amazon ecosystems strongly influences the sources of these
gases.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 1</b>: What is the magnitude of the exchange of trace gases (especially CH<sub>4</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O and NOx) from the entire Amazon Basin?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 2</b>: How do the patterns of soil-atmosphere trace-gas fluxes resulting from
conversion of forest to pasture vary across soils and climate in the Amazon basin and what
are the controlling variables?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 3</b>: How will intensive pasture management, (e.g. fertilization, fire, and
mechanization) affect soil-atmosphere trace gas exchange?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 4</b>: How do the magnitudes of the trace-gas fluxes at various pasture sites
change as a function of time?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 5</b>: Do selective logging and related practices have a significant effect on
soil -atmosphere exchange of trace gas and what is the temporal evolution of these fluxes
as forest sites recover from logging impacts?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 6</b>: What measurements and models are necessary to regionally extrapolate
the effects of pasture conversion and selective logging on trace gas fluxes?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 7</b>: Can models be developed that link ecosystem processes and physical
controls to predict methane emissions from inundated areas and can these be linked to
provide basin wide predictions of methane emissions?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 8</b>: How does variation in topography affect soil-atmosphere trace-gas
exchange in natural and disturbed systems. How do hydrological and biogeochemical
processes in the riparian zone affect the emission of trace gases?</p>

<p>As a second priority we pose questions related to trace gases which potentially have
large sources or sinks in the Amazon Basin. There are few measurements of the sources and
sinks of these gases within the Amazon and the effect of land-use change is unknown.</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 9</b>: What are the magnitudes and variability of CO and VOC emissions with
respect to vegetation associations, climate, soils and disturbance gradients across the
Amazon Basin?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 10</b>: What are the major controls on CO and VOC production and emissions, do
these emissions vary according to plant species and higher levels of taxonomy or plant
functional type, and can these be simulated by simple models based on ecological factors?</p>
<b>

<p>QUESTION 11</b>: What are the magnitudes of OCS and CS<sub>2</sub> exchange with soil
and vegetation?</p>

<p>We do not plan to focus our research on the direct emissions of trace gases from
biomass burning as the primarily ground-based studies which we envision are not ideally
suited to attack this issue. However, we encourage collaborations which will link biomass
burning studies to the terrestrial ecology program. We also explicitly consider the
importance of burning to carbon dynamics, nutrient cycling, and as a tool in land-use
change (see associated sections). Several international campaigns have focused their
efforts on biomass burning emissions and research in this area is active. We recognize
that fire is a major tool for land management and that any study of land-use change in the
Amazon Basin must consider fire effects. Fire is used for initial clearing of primary
forest and second growth and for continuing management of pasture and crops. Undisturbed
evergreen forest has a low susceptibility to fire. However, logged forest in areas of
seasonal drought may be more flammable. In the cerrado, fire is a prominent natural and
anthropogenic disturbance. Fire emissions have major impact on atmospheric chemistry.
Fires also will continue to modify ecosystem emissions for times from weeks to years
following their occurrence. Understanding post-fire effects will be critical to the
success of our study.</p>

</b>

<p>Natural gradients of environmental factors controlling trace gas fluxes provide a
powerful geographic framework for the experimental design. We should study the following
gradients to understand source and sink dynamics of trace gas exchange for Amazonia,
particularly in areas of rapid land-use change. 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>Moisture, drought/precipitation - Moisture gradients across the basin can be thought of
    in two possible ways: (1) Length of the drought period; and (2) total annual
    precipitation. In order to capture the moisture gradients sites will need to be selected
    in a figurative &quot;transect&quot; from the northwest to the southeast areas of the
    Amazon region.</li>
  <li>Soil type, drainage and fertility - Soils of the Amazon Basin fall into three main
    taxonomic orders according to the USDA classification Oxisols, Ultisols and Entisols
    (alluvial soils). Oxisols and Ultisols have the greatest areal extent. Alfisols and
    Spodosols also are found in substantial amounts across the basin. Spodosols are less
    suitable for agricultural development and are therefore under lower development pressure.
    Fertile Alfisols may be a specific focus of agricultural intensification. Unfortunately,
    the taxonomic distinctions may not provide us with a basis for distinguishing relevant
    ecological properties of the soils such as base status, texture and structure. Taxonomic
    soil maps may define regions based upon a dominant soil type which may not represent soils
    in small areas. Great care must be taken in experimental design to consider soil fertility
    and drainage at specific study sites.</li>
  <li>Land cover / land use. Disturbance (both natural and anthropogenic) and utilization
    gradients exist at a variety of scales across the basin. Deforestation and development
    follow roadways, and river courses and are most concentrated around the perimeter of the
    basin. Paired or nested trace gas sampling schemes comparing different land use and
    management practices to the undisturbed system across chronosequences of utilization will
    be essential to develop and test process level models of trace gas exchange.</li>
  <li>Disturbance frequency / history. This is a temporal, sequential gradient. For example
    forest to crop to pasture may have different implications to trace gas dynamics than a use
    pattern such as forest to pasture to crop. Time since clearing and the number of forest to
    clearing to forest cycles that a system goes through may also affect the trace gas
    dynamics of an area.</li>
  <li>Topography - The topographical context in which the trace gas fluxes occur has to be
    considered. Subtle changes in the elevation, land form, drainage, etc. of a landscape can
    have significant effects on the variability of gas exchange between the atmosphere and a
    particular biome.</li>
</ol>

<p>These five gradients of conditions can be thought of as a multi-dimensional
environmental space. From this space, we must select study sites which represent
associations of conditions that are most prominent in the basin today or those that we
believe will be important in the future. In addition, we should select sites that will
cover sufficient variation along all 5 gradients so that adequate data is available for
model construction and validation.</p>

<p>It is also very important to consider the wetlands of the Amazon. While the areas and
inundation periods of these wetlands are poorly quantified, there is little doubt that the
basin contains one of the largest areas of wetland of any region on earth. Preliminary
estimates suggest that these areas may account for as much as 10% of the annual global
production of methane. Given the potential magnitude of this source, the limited areal
extent for methane production, and the relatively long atmospheric lifetime of methane,
several research questions arise. The key controlling factors include temperature and
thermal stratification, bathymetry, primary productivity, plant cover and the spatial and
temporal inundation patterns. In order to obtain a better regional flux estimate we need: 

<ol>
  <li>improved estimates of the total area of different wetland habitats (e.g. flooded forest,
    floating meadows, emergent macrophytes and open water) and their seasonal variability;</li>
  <li>additional and improved measurements of fluxes and the associated uncertainties in these
    habitats;</li>
  <li>careful investigation of the factors controlling the spatial and temporal variability of
    the production and flux of CH<sub>4</sub> with</li>
  <li>the ultimate aim of developing process level models of emission that can be used to
    extrapolate measurements across space and time.</li>

</u>

<p>As a first design consideration, sites for ecological studies should be replicated.
Care must be taken to select sites for comparison on similar soils. Land-use histories
should be investigated as fully as possible using remote sensing, aerial photography, and
local records and residents.</p>

<p>Numerous methods have been used for the study of biosphere-atmosphere trace gas
exchange. Enclosure methods whether for soils or vegetation are perhaps the simplest
approach. Enclosures allow for rapid measurements of long-lived and some reactive gases.
The small area of enclosure measurements can be a disadvantage; but one that can be
compensated for by using stratified sampling approaches combined with landscape and
vegetation classifications for sample selection and extrapolation. In addition to chamber
measurements, in wetland areas, fluxes of various trace gases may be estimated from
air-water concentration gradients and models of gas exchange.</p>

<p>The small scale of enclosure measurements make experimental manipulations technically
and economically feasible. Manipulations are useful for studies of mechanisms controlling
trace gas production and emission. Understanding controls on emissions is necessary to
develop process models which can be used for extrapolation of results beyond the immediate
measurement area. Process oriented experiments can provide a valuable complement to
extensive field measurements in particular when linked to development of process models.
Simple manipulations (wetting, drying, shading, fertilization, etc.) can be achieved with
limited infrastructure. The addition of inhibitors of specific processes and/or isotopic
tracer compounds may be required to investigate individual steps of overall reaction
sequences.</p>

<p>Micrometeorological methods for studying trace gas fluxes may be applied to nearly all
trace gases. The available micrometeorological approaches include gradient techniques,
eddy correlation, and eddy correlation related techniques such as eddy accumulation and
conditional sampling. These techniques may be applied from a variety of platforms such as
towers, tethered balloons, and aircraft which cover scales which range from 1 to 10,000
ha.</p>

<p>At each local scale trace gas study site a number of ancillary measurements are
required in order to place the trace gas measurements within an environmental and climatic
context to allow efficient modeling and intercomparisons. The minimal suite of
accompanying measurements should include soil and vegetation characterizations and
meteorological data. Soils characterizations should minimally include pH, bulk density,
organic matter content, N-mineralization, moisture, and temperature. Adequate samples and
profiles descriptions should be available to classify soils according to the USDA system.
Co-location of trace gas studies with studies of vegetation productivity and biomass are
recommended. Preferably, meteorological measurements should include temperature, relative
humidity, PAR, net radiation, wind speed, and precipitation. These variables should be
recorded automatically in at least hourly time steps. The suite of meteorological
variables will allow estimation of the site water balance using a Penman-Monteith
approximation.</p>

</u>

<p>Budget studies may be possible using atmospheric transport models and ground-based or
aircraft based measurements. The scale of the measurements will depend upon the lifetime
of the gases involved and the length scale of the integration of the measurement. For
meso-scale and regional studies we hope to collaborate with the atmospheric chemistry
component and other components of the LBA study. Initial feasibility tests are planned to
demonstrate that the budgets for long-lived gases such as CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O
may be quantified using a basin-wide measurement approach. On a local scale, budgets of
trace gases in the nocturnal boundary layer could allow estimates of gas exchanges at
intermediate distance and time scales.</p>

<p>It is desirable to have aircraft measurements of trace gas fluxes. This will require
collaboration with the atmospheric chemists and other components of the LBA study. When
light aircraft are preferred, strong consideration should be given to adding
instrumentation to Brazilian aircraft rather than transporting fully equipped light
aircraft from other locales. High frequency measurements of CO, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>
would be useful, particularly for CH<sub>4</sub> exchange over wetlands and to provide
constraints on the CO production from soils and vegetation. Additionally, low frequency
measurement of N<sub>2</sub>O and biogenic VOC, would help provide confirmation to ground
based studies of chemical composition used for budget studies and characterization of
basin-wide distributions of sources and sinks.</p>

<p>Isotope tracers (<sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, etc.) may be used over
a variety of scales from mechanistic experiments through budget studies. Natural abundance
of isotopic tracers can provide useful information regarding the processes leading to
trace gas production. Isotopic tracers provide useful constraints on biological processes
as well as constraints on emissions from sources with different signatures or the dilution
of a source into a background. </p>

<p>The integrated LBA study must provide or make available for comparison standard gases
or common standards for all trace gas investigators. Common standards should be referenced
to a recognized standard such as supplied by NIST. This is especially important with
respect to ambient atmospheric levels when basin-scale gradients may be small in an
absolute sense. In the case of more reactive gases such as NO, a special effort will be
required to assure the stability of standards over the course of the program.</p>

</u>

<p>Modeling approaches will be necessary for the understanding of trace gas production and
the extrapolation of trace gas emissions to regional scales. Several ecosystem models
(e.g. CENTURY, CASA) have been developed that incorporate some aspects of trace gas
production and emission into their framework. Models (which may explicitly incorporate
isotopes) are used to understand turnover rates of soil carbon pools and associated
mineralization processes. Other more detailed models (e.g. DNDC) have been developed
specifically to predict site specific trace gas emissions from soils. Rudimentary models
exist to predict the emission of VOC from vegetation based on the physical controls of
light and temperature. Further efforts are necessary to model basal emission rates given
known ecological controls. To date, we have only site-specific empirical models of CH<sub>4</sub>
production and emission. Process-based models should be developed to predict CH<sub>4</sub>
production from ecosystems. Further model development will be needed both to guide the
design of the field experiment and to help to interpret and extrapolate results. A program
of model intercomparisons based on a common set of environmental drivers would facilitate
efforts to improve process understanding while minimizing duplication of efforts in
developing model input data sets.</p>

</b>

<p>Several criteria must be employed to select suitable sites. A first group will assure
that a representative sample of the Amazon region is included in our study design.
Practical considerations will make it impossible to cover all possible combinations of
these criteria. 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>edaphic -- a variety of soil characteristics including fertility and drainage status
    should be accessible from the suite of intensive study sites, </li>
  <li>climatic -- the suite of intensive study sites should cover the range of total rainfall
    and drought intensity, </li>
  <li>vegetation associations -- ideally sites will be chosen to cover a range of different
    vegetation associations, and </li>
  <li>disturbance frequency and history -- although each site has a unique history, these may
    have some similarity across regions owing to the unique sets of social and economic
    circumstances that drive development in different areas. </li>
</ol>

<p>A second group of two criteria will be important to assure the success of the
anticipated experiments. 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>logistics -- we must consider the cost and difficulty of travel in and out of selected
    sites as well as the facilities (power, water, housing, etc.) available at each possible
    site, and </li>
  <li>research history -- a history of prior research should be a strong consideration for
    site selection. Useful prior data include basic information such as topography, soil
    classification, climate records, vegetation classification, and land-use history records.
    Additional studies regarding nutrient cycles, productivity, and trace gas exchange will be
    helpful, but not critical to site selection.</li>

<ul>
  <p>&#149; Estimated trace gas emission maps for Amazonia, including measures of
  uncertainty.</p>
</ul>

<p>The desired resolutions for these emission maps are 1 km spatial and hourly to daily
temporal. The rationale for this relatively high resolution product goal is based on
potential for evaluation of model estimates in comparison to tower and aircraft flux
measurements. The anticipated use of multi-temporal satellite data sets as input drivers
to ecosystem models should make this product resolution feasible from a purely technical
point of view, i.e. major extrapolation and model driver requirements will be available at
1 km resolution from AVHRR data. The ultimate success in producing a full region flux
product could depend, however, on the quality of other surface data sets used for
extrapolation and process modeling, namely soils and vegetation classifications. 

<ul>
  <p>&#149; Refinement of existing trace gas flux models</p>
</ul>

<p>There are several model formulations for trace gas fluxes that are under testing for
regional and site-specific application in Amazonian environments. The gas fluxes currently
being estimated at the ecosystem level are mainly for CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO,
and to a lesser degree, methane consumption in soils and volatile organic carbon emissions
from plant canopies. In some cases, gridded spatial models will need to be improved with
new data sets for climate, soils, and remotely sensed data, and with new process knowledge
concerning plant-soil-atmosphere interactions and land-use changes. Model products should
be general enough to permit application across gradients of intensive (tower) study sites.

<ul>
  <p>&#149; Development of new trace gas flux models</p>
</ul>

<p>The main product for development of new process models is for methane emissions in
wetland ecosystems and for VOC emissions from vegetation. Development of such models
should be tied closely to field studies of emissions and processes. 

<ul>
  <p>&#149; Prediction of emission scenarios in given land-cover scenarios</p>
</ul>

<p>Improved estimation of trace gas fluxes will be associated with the land cover/use
types represented in gradient and tower measurement sites. New information will be
generated to address spatial and temporal variability in gas emissions and their
biogeochemical and physical controllers. Eventual coupling of nutrient cycling, land use,
and trace gas flux models is envisioned.</p>

<p></b>The Amazon Basin is being transformed from a relatively pristine system of forests
and savannas to one of land systems altered by deforestation and agricultural use. As is
discussed at length elsewhere in this document, conversion to pastures, selective logging,
burning, and regrowth following abandonment have and are expected to have profound impacts
on the storage of carbon, dynamics of nutrients in different types of vegetation, and on
trace gases. These land-use changes will also result in significant alterations in the
flow of water through the impacted drainage basins, with consequent feedbacks on the
sediment transport and biogeochemistry of the region&#146;s river systems.</p>
<b>

<p></b>The river corridors of a region express the interaction of hydrologic processes and
the land surface (Figure 1). River corridors accumulate the runoff that is the excess of
the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration of the surrounding areas. Surface
waters are capable of sediment transport and can shape their channels, often creating main
channels and less frequently inundated floodplains. The annual distribution of discharge
in streams and rivers is determined by precipitation patterns, transit times and available
storage. In small basins, storage is small and transit times are short and uniform, so
storm events can create temporary conditions of flooding or high water that fall off
rapidly. In large basins, rivers receive water from many different areas upstream and
transit times can vary, so runoff is averaged over time and extended periods of high water
and flooding occur during times of high precipitation in the basin. The hydrology of
wetlands, including the position of the water table, is more variable. Wetlands may be
associated with flowing water, such as river floodplains, or they may be located in areas
of low permeability soils or of constricted drainage.</p>

<p>The Amazon is a region defined by its abundance of water. This abundance is evident in
the extensive river system which culminates in the world's largest river and its
associated areas of periodically inundated land. Sippel et al. (1992) estimated that the
main stem floodplain covers about 100,000 km<sup>2</sup>, Junk and Furch (1993) estimate
that the floodplain of the Amazon main-stem and primary tributaries cover about 300,000 km<sup>2</sup>,
whereas riparian zones of small rivers may cover about 1 million km<sup>2</sup>.
Furthermore, savannas exposed to sheet flooding in Roraima, the Rupununi district, along
the Río Araguaia, and in northeast Bolivia may account for another 200,000-250,000 km<sup>2</sup>.
That is, on the order of 15-30% of the area of the basin is subject to periodic saturation
and inundation. </p>

<p>These periodically or permanently flooded areas play important roles in the hydrology
and biogeochemistry of the basin. Because these poorly drained areas often receive
transfers of water and materials from nearby and upstream uplands, they are subject to
indirect impacts as the uplands undergo development. As these areas support productive
ecosystems including resources such as timber and fish, they are also subject to impacts
from direct human actions. The nature of the surface waters and poorly-drained areas are
shaped by hydrologic transfers in the horizontal as well as vertical direction, and their
biogeochemistry goes beyond the aerobic reactions expected in the uplands to include
anaerobic reactions such as methanogenesis and denitrification. When saturated, soils in
these regions present potentially anaerobic conditions where microbiological activities
such as methane production and denitrification </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="../../../../invest/docs/reports/ManausReport/image4.jpg" alt="a water cycle" width="426" height="290"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>prevail. Hence, an accurate estimate of gas exchange between the land and the
atmosphere must consider saturated and flooded regions. In addition these areas form the
boundaries between upland areas and open surface water and receive water, organic carbon,
and nutrients from the upland environments. The most visible example of the importance of
these areas in the Amazon is the floodplain along the main-stem, which has been estimated
to produce 5-10% of the global flux of CH<sub>4</sub> from wetlands to the atmosphere
(Devol et al., 1994). </p>

<p>To ultimately relate the river signals to the productivity of a basin we must consider
the rates of carbon and nutrient movement through the overall plant/soil/river system
environments in response to changing hydrologic regimes. The definition of these linkages
between regional-scale land surface processes and the capability of river systems to
transport and process land-derived materials is a key issue. The tasks required to
describe the movement of carbon and nutrient species include partitioning overall
ecosystem production into species produced in periodically inundated zones and species
produced in well-drained zones, then tracking the respective species through the drainage
system. In practice, this involves development of river basin models. The central premise
of a river basin model is that the constituents of river water provide a continuous,
integrated record of upstream processes that vary systematically depending upon changing
interactions of flowing water with the landscape and the interplay of biological and
physical processes (Karlsson et al., 1988; Billen et al., 1991). That is, the chemical
signatures of riverine materials can be used to identify different drainage basin source
regions, reaches or stages, and can be tied to landscape-related processes such as
chemical weathering and nutrient retention by local vegetation (Meyer et al., 1988).
Rivers should respond with differing magnitudes and lags to natural or anthropogenic
perturbations depending on the processes involved and the downstream transfer rates of
their characteristic products. </p>

</b>

<p>The above summary raises some of the key issues about surface water chemistry that must
be addressed in the Amazon ecological study, namely the responses of organic matter and
nutrient cycles in Amazonian ecosystems to forest conversion. Understanding these
responses is an essential precursor to assessing their impact on the quality of the
natural environment, the health of the human population, and chemical composition of the
atmosphere. In the area of river corridors and surface water chemistry covered by this
Amazon ecological study science plan, the overall question is: 

<ul>
  <ul>
    <p>What are the changes in the pathways and fluxes of organic matter, nutrients, and
    associated elements through river corridors (riparian, floodplain, channels, wetlands) as
    a function of land cover?</p>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Changes in hydrology, in particular the quantity and timing of water supplied by
precipitation and subsequent flow paths to and through river channels, establish the
moisture regimes. Hydrology is addressed extensively elsewhere in LBA. Here we highlight
those activities: 

<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Effects of deforestation on stream discharges and the influence on the pattern of
      seasonal inundation.</li>
    <li>Change in the flow paths that mobilize dissolved elements from soil water to streams,
      such as an increase in overland flow.</li>
    <li>Effects of increasing erosion and the changes in channel geomorphology.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Changes in carbon cycling and organic-matter retention are expected with changes in
land use and hydrology. Questions that address the nature of the transfer of organic
matter from terrestrial to river environments as well as the riverine fate of organic
material include. </p>

<p>How do emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> vary along a transect from
uplands to the riparian zone and stream?</p>

<p>How will the composition and quantity of organic matter entering and being processed
within streams be altered under different land-use change scenarios? Are there unique
organic signatures that can be traced down-stream?</p>

<p>To what extent do intact riparian zones buffer streams against changes due to
anthropogenic activities in surrounding uplands?</p>

<p>Changes in nitrogen and phosphorus cycling are expected:</p>

<p>How are changes in nitrogen loading and chemistry following forest conversion
transported to riparian zones and through to streams, and what processes regulate this
transport? </p>

<p>How do magnitudes of N<sub>2</sub>O production in flooded near-stream soils compare
with those in well-drained upland soils?</p>

<p>Does land-use change lead to the release of P that can be used for production in
surface waters?</p>

</b>

<p>The nature of the research required to address these questions crosses multiple scales,
from the individual stream to the mouths of major tributaries. The following should not be
thought of as a rigid scaling exercise but as examples of what might be done to proceed
from the detailed land /stream couplings at one site to the responses of larger rivers to
the inputs from aggregate land surfaces, and on to the basin-wide processes integrated
into the largest reaches of the river system. An important linkage across scales is the
use of not only &quot;bulk&quot; chemistry (CH<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, DOC) but also
tracers and organic geochemical &quot;fingerprints&quot; which retain information about
the significant processes that influence the final concentrations and fluxes exported by
rivers. </p>

Scale&quot;</a></p>
</u>

<p>Detailed experiments conducted at individual field sites are critical to developing a
process-based understanding of the responses of Amazon ecosystems to changes in land use.
The understanding derived from these experiments may be translated into hydrologic and
biogeochemical models of how nutrients move to, through, and out of the soil environment,
and to the atmosphere, to streams, and within streams. Use of a generalized watershed
approach, which integrates land-water interactions, is one approach in determining the
hydrologic and hydrogeochemical consequences of land-use change.</p>

<p>Small watershed studies where the export of water, sediments, nutrients, and organic
matter can be quantified are as important to the horizontal transport issue as are
instrumented towers to the vertical flux component. Land-use change invariably leads to
changes in material export from land to water. Testing models of land-use change effects
will require sites where quantitative export measurements can be made. These export
estimates yield two essential products (1) boundary conditions for the upland water,
sediment, carbon and nutrient budgets and (2) an input of material to riparian zones and
streams. The fate of this exported material must be known before any accounting of the
impact of deforestation on the biogeochemistry and ecology of the basin can be finalized.</p>

<p>(1) Using paired basins (disturbed vs. undisturbed) is a means of assessing how fluxes
and their controlling processes might change. A classic approach to this problem is to
construct nutrient budgets of paired, gauged &quot;small watersheds.&quot; As a complement
to small watershed budget studies, we envision use of hydrologic modeling coupled with
measurements and models of how nutrients move to and through the soil environment, both to
the atmosphere and to the streams. The following activities would contribute to the
development of the necessary process understanding.</p>

<p>At least one pair of watersheds (presumably available from the hydrology component of
LBA) should be intensively instrumented, monitored, and studied to determine the water
balance and flow paths. Models which explicitly specify flow paths and volumes are
required together with soil water chemistry and soil process information to estimate
solute delivery to riparian zones and stream channels. </p>

<p>(2) Sampling transects of soil solution and trace gas fluxes from uplands through
riparian zones into streams in which the partitioning of organic matter and nutrients into
gaseous, liquid, and particulate phases is tracked will identify the sequence of substrate
and oxidation/reduction conditions which control the partitioning and degradation
pathways. Such measurements should be made at paired-basin sites, and include measurements
of atmospheric deposition. </p>

<p>At the local or microscale it is feasible to locate small streams with watersheds
dominated by contrasting land use. Through use of either paired streams or transects along
a single stream crossing land-use boundaries, it is possible to assess some of the
influences of land use on stream chemistry and solute transport. </p>

<p>(3) Distributed surveys of stream chemistry as a function of diverse local ambient
conditions and land-use patterns will allow an extension of the models that would be
developed in the more intensive study areas to a wider range of conditions.</p>

<p>An important question that represents an interface between the local and the meso-scale
horizontal transport and processing questions is &quot;how far do sediments, nutrients,
and organic matter travel before they are taken up, decomposed, temporarily stored,
permanently buried or degassed to the atmosphere? The factors controlling the processing,
transformation and transport of material will change in going from small to larger
streams. While some signals can be detected downstream, much of the biogeochemical
activity related to land use will take place in low order streams and their riparian zones
close to the site of the disturbance. The development of models of deforestation effects
on river corridor biogeochemistry will require measurements of stream processes along
transects from the microscale to the meso-scale and beyond.</p>

&quot;Meso-Scale&quot;</a></p>
</u>

<p>Selection of meso-scale drainage basins represents a series of trade-offs in terms of
choosing the size of the basin, representation of characteristic land forms, and
logistics. In accordance with the hydrology studies described elsewhere in LBA, a
meso-scale basin is defined as being on the order of 10,000 Km<sup>2</sup>. This scale is
large enough to require integrating approaches. It is possible to find comparable paired
basins that are forested/deforested (whereas it becomes much more difficult to select
candidate basins on the order of 100,000 Km<sup>2</sup>). It also is on the order of the
scale desired for linking to global climate models.</p>

<p>To account for the practicality of what is feasible yet will provide a broad level of
information, the hydrological component of LBA has suggested selecting one region made up
of several meso-scale basins as the primary region for intensive research. A small number
of secondary sites would represent a more diverse set of environments. The greater Jamarí
region of Rondônia (comprising the Jamarí, Jiparaná and Candeias river basins) has been
recommended as the primary site. The emphasis on the primary site should be on the field
research and modeling required to characterize meso-scale level processes. The emphasis on
the secondary sites should be to make a reduced set of measurements which would allow the
extension and testing of the models and methodologies developed for the primary site. This
approach is compatible with the surface water chemistry dynamics research described in
this document.</p>

<p>Given the recommendation of Rondônia for the primary site, secondary sites should
represent some of the other important environments of the whole Amazon basin, with
different soil types, relief, and climatology. The necessity of including Andean source
areas is recognized.</p>

<p>A significant problem in analyzing the impacts of land-use change on aquatic systems is
how far downstream local changes can be detected. There are several approaches to this
problem. 

<ol>
  <li>Measurements along a river continuum of stream chemistry and gas exchange can address
    the problem of at what points can we detect evidence of land-use change and at what point
    are those signals lost. Modeling of transfers based on soil texture, stream density, and
    other such factors can then take that information and map it onto the hydrologic modeling
    done elsewhere in LBA for regional-scale descriptions and predictions.</li>
  <li>Element budgets (of meso-scale regions) can then be constructed, comparing fluxes of
    gases (as measured by aircraft or tower arrays) to extensive measures of stream chemistry
    of rivers in the intermediate size range (3rd to 6th or 7th order). </li>
  <li>Modeling of transfers based on land uses monitored by remote sensing is now possible
    because of the ability to use TM-level resolution of suspended sediments in surface
    waters.</li>
</ol>

Scale&quot;</a></p>
</u>

<p>A functional basin scale in the context here would be the downstream segments of the
major tributaries, such as the Rio Madeira, Rio Tapajos, Rio Xingu, or Rio Tocantins. At
this scale, the dynamics of factors controlling basin output from smaller scales (above)
would be aggregated, and the subsequent output would be comparable to the whole-basin
scale of the hydrology/energy component of LBA. However, while the scope of the following
activities is commensurate with the whole basin, the emphasis would be given to those
river systems most heavily impacted by land-use change. 

<ol>
  <li>Time series measurements of dissolved and particulate fractions are necessary to
    establish the basic compositional regime of the river. Emphasis should include those
    tracers of terrestrial-scale controls that persist through the river system. </li>
  <li>Basin-scale modeling would be based on the hydrologic routing modeling from elsewhere in
    LBA, and the process-level understanding derived from the previous studies in this
    section. The objective is to predict the output hydrographs of water and chemical
    constituents (versus the measured time series) under different conditions of land-use. </li>
  <li>Analysis of the temporal and spatial pattern of inundation across the study region is
    necessary to estimate trace gas fluxes and nutrient processing within these systems.</li>

</u><b>

<p></b>Remote sensing of the lakes and floodplains in the Amazon basin can provide
quantitative information on open water, floating macrophytes and flooded forest, and
regional inundation. Side-looking airborne radar (X band) imagery permits the measurement
of lake shapes and areas. Satellite altimeters permits estimation of stage for large
rivers. Application of such techniques as spectral mixture analysis to Landsat MSS and TM
imagery permits calculation of the concentration of suspended sediments in surface waters.
Videogeography from low-flying aircraft allows repetitive estimation of the areal extent
of floating macrophytes and sediment-laden floodwaters, including when smoke and clouds
reduce the capability of satellite platforms. Application of linear mixing models to
thermal emissions measured by satellite-borne passive microwave sensors (SSMI, SSMR)
permits determination of inundation area on a regional scale. AVHRR data are of sufficient
spatial and temporal coverage to provide regional-scale coverage of vegetation attributes
and physical variables (radiation, temperature). Synthetic aperture radar sensors (on
aircraft, space shuttle or satellite) have great promise for studies of macrophytes and
forests on the floodplain because they are not limited by cloud cover or solar
illumination, and they are sensitive to vegetation structure and are able to detect
flooding beneath vegetation.</p>

</u>

<p>To ultimately relate surface water chemistry to the productivity of the basin, the
rates of carbon and nutrient movement through the overall plant/soil/river environments in
responses to changing hydrological regimes must be described. A means of generalizing
findings on flows and storage on the valley floor to conditions on the surface is
required. The problem, then, is to establish patterns of organic matter production and
mineralization that serve as the antecedents for the organic matter and nutrients exported
to the river system. In practice, this calls for remote sensing and modeling, coupled to
water chemistry.</p>

<p>A model that examines how the biogeochemistry of the river system is related to the
productivity of the respective river basin assumes that the quantity and composition of
dissolved and particulate bioactive materials in a parcel of water at any downstream node
in the river system is predictable as the product of a common set of processes which occur
differentially, according to upstream conditions of relative topography, soil chemistry
and texture, water residence, and floodplain extent.</p>

<p>Clearly there are multiple modeling approaches that could be used. For example, as a
starting point, models such as CASA, TEM, CENTURY, or FOREST BGC might be coupled to
hydrology models which can &quot;produce&quot; a volume flow of water and deliver that
water and chemistry to a river network. This is an approach that can be used across
scales, from micro- to whole basin. Biophyscial attributes such as the production plus
soil texture and chemistry, elevation, and land cover can be described by geographical
element (scale dependent). How to ascribe a characteristic chemistry per element is a
critical research issue.</p>
