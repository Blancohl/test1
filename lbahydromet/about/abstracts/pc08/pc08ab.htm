Surface Energy Balance<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p><font size="2">The goal of this project is to explore methods
for simultaneously assimilating remotely sensed data (on land cover, surface
temperature and surface radiation) to improve the diagnosis of the Amazon
surface energy budget in CPTEC models. The research explores aggregation
techniques that can be used to incorporate the effects of the subgrid-scale (~1
km) heterogeneity that is resolved in the remotely sensed data at the (~ 30 km)
grid scale used in the mesoscale models.</font>
<p><font size="2">Aggregation theory is based on the requirements
that area-average scalar fluxes must be conserved, and that the model used to
describe area-average land-surface-atmosphere exchanges at the grid-scale should
have the same form as the model used to describe such exchanges at the pixel
scale. Applying these requirements simultaneously to the equations describing
surface momentum exchange and surface energy exchange at both the grid and
subgrid scale leads to identification of relations between the parameters that
control exchange between the surface and a &quot;blending height&quot; in the
lower atmosphere at the two scales. In general, the resulting relationships
express the parameters to be used at the larger grid-scale in terms of weighted
summations of those that apply at the smaller pixel-scale. In principle, it
ought also to be possible to assimilate relevant subgrid-scale remotely sensed
information via aggregation algorithms based on this approach to improve the
estimates of grid-average surface fluxes.</font>
<p><font size="2">Preliminary work is being carried out over the
Tennessee Valley in the USA, where the RAMS model coupled with the SiB2 model
and nested inside the Eta analysis fields is being run over a 256 by 256 km area
with a 1 km resolution. The calculated surface fluxes and near-surface
atmospheric variables are regarded as the &quot;truth&quot;. Low resolution (30
km) model runs are then made to simulate the GEWEX mesoscale model grids and (1)
explore the value of the &quot;aggregate&quot; and &quot;tile&quot; hypothesis
for combining several different remotely sensed data streams; (2) determine
whether surface temperature for the cloud-free portion can be used to deduce the
soil moisture for the whole grid square; (3) test whether mesoscale circulations
compromise the effectiveness of these hypotheses; (4) test whether topography
compromises the effectiveness of these hypotheses. Model studies will be made in
two regions in the LBA domain (Rondonia and Santarem) that have different
heterogeneous land covers, and where there will be LBA field data for
calibration/validation. To further this research, data from the CPTEC Eta model
is being routinely downloaded. At present approximately 9 months of data are
available.</font>
<p><font size="2">A CPTEC student, Luis G. Gonçalves de Gonçalves,
has been identified to carry out doctoral research at the University of Arizona
in support of this project and we are exploring options to obtain the required
funding. Eleanor Burke will visit CPTEC for 1 month in early 2000.</font>
