<p class="default-style">This study compares the volumes of coarse woody debris produced in an area, with the another one logged forest  by reduced impact logging methods, in called property Farm Saint Marta (3°04'S, 49°14'W). This locates-itself in the hidrográfic basin of the medium river Moju, city homonym, Northeast of the State of Pará, Eastern Amazônia, Brazil. The studies had been carried through in total area of 426Ha, referring the 4 Units of Work immediate of forest management areas. Two of these units had been explored by reduced impact logging, totalizing 217Ha, and  the others two in undisturberd forest totalizing 209Ha. It was used line intercept sampling for as method to quantify the coarse woody debris in 6,000 m of lines for each situation, totalizing 12,000 m of sampling lines. The fallen woody debris was measured on the forest floor, with superior diameter 10 cm, considering the diameter and the state of decomposition of the measured parts, for the calculation of the volume and necromassa, associates to the indices of density of the specific wood for each decay class.  It was demonstrated with the results, through statistical tests, to have significant difference of estimates of volume and necromassa, and highly significant difference in the carbon supply, between the studied situations. In the primary forest the volume was estimated about 80 m³ha-1  and the carbon supply about 28,30 Mgha-1 In the forest logged using reduced impact methods the volume was estimated about 137 m³ha-1  and the carbon supply about 43,23 m³ha-1. The estimates of necromass and carbon will serve to contribute towards the monitoring of the emissions of greenhouse gases emitted by the coarse woody debris as well for calculations for the commercialization of carbon credits.

Key words: coarse woody debris, Amazonia, reduced impact logging, line intercept sampling,  volume, necromassa,  carbon supply
