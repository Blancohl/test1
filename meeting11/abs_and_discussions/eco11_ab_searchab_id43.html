<p class="default-style">The worst drought in decades struck SW Amazonia in 2005 and paradoxically provided an opportunity to apply LBA research to development and conservation issues. Since the late 1990s, the LBA research network and scientific meetings had informed the LBA-Acre group of the dangers of extended droughts and associated fires.  Consequently, we were able to alert the Acrean society of the danger of forest fires in early August 2005.  Colleagues from INPE and University of Maryland began supplying detailed hot pixel and burn scar data as the fires spread during September.  In late September and early October, LBA-Acre students and researchers coordinated satellite and airborne remote sensing data for the Acre fire fighting program. We estimated that fires affected over 400,000 ha of tropical moist forests in the region and found that hot pixel satellite data did not effectively detect these forest fires. Smoke levels in late September rose an order of magnitude above maximum permissible levels in eastern Acre.  Former students and researchers now occupy leadership roles at the Federal University of Acre, state and municipal government agencies, research institutions and non-governmental organizations where they are applying their accrued experience from LBA for regional development and conservation, as well as educating a new generation of researchers and decision-makers.  The LBA-Acre group has also helped in curriculum reform in rural schools. The MAP (Madre de Dios-Peru, Acre-Brasil, Pando-Bolivia) Initiative has expanded the LBA-Acre experience to collaboration between the Civil Defenses, the remote sensing communities, and river basin management groups in the three countries.  More recently, this collaboration has extended to a program of adaptation to and mitigation of global environmental change in the MAP Region.</p>
