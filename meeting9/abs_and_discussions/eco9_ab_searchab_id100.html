<p class="default-style">Migration has been a neglected topic in studies of population-land use interrelationships in frontier areas in the Amazon basin as well as elsewhere. This paper will take a broad view of the linkages between migration and the striking changes in the landscape in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA) over the past three decades.  Our discussion is divided into four parts. First, we provide an overview of the effects on LCLU of the discovery of petroleum near Lago Agrio in 1967 following the construction of roads and oil pipelines to move the oil across the Andes for export.  This led to massive in-migration of agricultural colonists in search of land, beginning in the 1970’s and continuing to the present, albeit at a lower level.  This will draw upon data from the four population censuses from 1974 to 2001. Second, we will examine the process of in-migration and colonization of the NEA in more detail based on data from a longitudinal survey of colonist families and farms carried out in the region in 1990 and 1999.  We indicate where the migrants to the Amazon are coming from, why they are leaving their areas of origin, and why they are choosing the Amazon destination, to the extent possible from the available data.  The third part focuses on a key issue not investigated in previous studies of agricultural colonization at the frontier in other sites: what happens to the people and their use of the land subsequently, that is, what does the next generation do--stay on the farm, move to towns in the region, move to other rural areas in the region creating new farms and a further wave of forest clearing, or return to the origin areas outside the Amazon?  Each of these has different implications for the environment, including LU. Data from the longitudinal survey and a linked survey of community leaders in 61 communities will be used to investigate these subsequent processes of population redistribution, including urbanization and further extensification of agriculture.  For this, statistical models, including multilevel models, will be used to investigate the determinants of migration decisions of members of colonist households.  Lastly, the paper will conclude with policy implications and suggestions for further research, in Ecuador and more generally in the Amazon context.</p>
