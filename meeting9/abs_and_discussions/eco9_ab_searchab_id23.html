<p class="default-style">Large expanses of Amazonian forest are being cleared and fragmented each year, but the impacts of habitat fragmentation on diverse Amazonian plant communities are poorly understood.  I summarize findings from a long-term (26-year) experimental study of tree-community composition in fragmented and intact forests in central Amazonia.  Results are derived from 40 1-ha permanent plots that were repeatedly sampled before and after fragment isolation.  Within these plots, trajectories of change have been assessed for 267 genera and 1162 individual tree species.  Rapid shifts in floristic composition are being driven by sharply accelerated tree mortality within ~300 m of fragment margins, causing population declines of many large-seeded, old-growth taxa, especially for larger (>60 cm diameter) trees.  Disturbance-tolerant species, such as pioneer trees and lianas, are rapidly increasing.  Pioneer and successional trees tripled in abundance in the first 1-2 decades after fragmentation, and are continuing to increase over time.  
	As a result of these changes, habitat fragmentation is fundamentally altering carbon storage and dynamics in Amazonian forests.  The rate of carbon cycling probably increases sharply, both because long-lived canopy and emergent trees decline in favor of shorter-lived successional trees and lianas, and because necromass production and turnover both increase.  Carbon storage in live vegetation also declines because small successional trees and lianas (which typically have low wood density) store substantially less carbon than do large, old-growth trees.  The decline and rapid decay of live biomass in forest fragments may produce substantial atmospheric carbon emissions, above and beyond that resulting from deforestation per se.
