<p class="default-style">Small streams act as important sites in the landscape where nutrients arriving from adjacent uplands are retained, transformed, or released to larger rivers. Our work focused on determining the effects of land use change on nutrient storage, export and transformation in streams draining forest and pasture using solute injections to examine the fate of N and P and <sup>15</sup>N tracers to examine the retention and export of N. We found that the uptake lengths for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> were shorter in pasture streams compared with similar forest streams. We conducted three <sup>15</sup>N additions (1 in forest; 2 in pasture streams) to determine how land use alters the stream N cycle, such as uptake by microorganisms and nitrification, and ultimately how the balance between storage and export is affected. The forest stream exported N, mostly in inorganic form  (87%), while the same size pasture stream (2nd order) was highly retentive of N, storing almost 88%, primarily in the riparian grasses, and exporting less than 15% predominately as suspended particulate N. The larger pasture stream exported approximately the same percentage of N (85%) as the forest stream, but the export was divided equally between inorganic forms (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and particulates. Riparian grasses in the larger pasture stream stored little N. Our <sup>15</sup>N additions indicated that replacing forest with pasture led to large differences in stream biogeochemical transformations and export. The overall effect of this change was to make small pasture watersheds more retentive of these nutrients than the original forested watersheds.</p>
