<p class="default-style">While much effort has been devoted to studying rural land-cover change in Rondônia, very little work has considered the relationship between urban areas and regional land-cover change.  A first step in building this connection is to characterize the physical environment of urban centers and their immediate surroundings.  The urban physical environment is composed of three primary components—vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil (V-I-S components), in addition to water.  Ten urban centers in Rondônia were selected for analysis, representing a range of populations, development histories, and economic activities.  For each urban sample, a 20x20-km region centered over the built-up area was subset from 1999 or 2000 Landsat ETM+ imagery.  Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was applied to each image subset, and the sub-pixel abundance of V-I-S components was mapped.  Accuracy of the modeled V-I-S fractions was assessed using high-resolution images mosaicked from digital aerial videography.  Several potentially significant findings emerge from this analysis.  First, modeled fractions and reference fractions were highly correlated, demonstrating the potential of moderate-resolution imagery to map the physical urban environment.  Second, model complexity—how many endmembers are required to accurately model each pixel—was related to the degree of human impact on the landscape, with highly impacted areas requiring more complex models.  This relationship was used to delineate the built-up extent of settlements, suggesting the possibility of automated mapping of urban extent.  Finally, V-I-S components captured inter- and intra-urban variability, suggesting that these data products can contribute to comparative studies of urbanizing areas.</p>
