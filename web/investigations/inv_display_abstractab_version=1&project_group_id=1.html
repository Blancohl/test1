This will entail<br><br>    producing or obtaining from collaborators filled micrometeorological<br><br>    timeseries data (no missing values in any “driver” variable) from the<br><br>    three Tapajos sites, and from as many other sites as possible. We will then<br><br>    run multiyear simulations of latent and sensible heat and net ecosystem<br><br>    exchange of CO2 at each site with SiB3 using local site meteorlogy and<br><br>    vegetation parameters. We will compare the simulated and observed<br><br>    seasonality in the three fluxes among sites near Santarem, Manaus, Rondonia,<br><br>    and possibly others. We will investigate the influence of seasonal drought<br><br>    on gross photosynthesis and respiration, and evaluate model simulation of<br><br>    the seasonality of net carbon flux along regional gradients of vegetation<br><br>    and of timing, severity, and duration of the dry season.</li><br><br></ol><br><br><ol style="margin-top:0in" start="2" type="1"><br><br>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><br><br>    <p class="default-style">Analyze<br><br>    the two-way interaction between drought and physiological stress in<br><br>    Amazonian ecosystems and the implications for possible amplification and<br><br>    persistence of regional drought as simulated in the “Amazon catastrophe”<br><br>    experiment of Cox et al (2000). Coupled simulations with SiB2 in the CSU GCM<br><br>    can reproduce this phenomenon for current climate. We will investigate the<br><br>    cause of this phenomenon in the current model, and explore what must be done<br><br>    in fully coupled climate simulations to produce such a catastrophe, and what<br><br>    model changes are required to avoid it. This work will include local-scale<br><br>    simulations and comparison to drought stress observed in the field, as well<br><br>    as a range of fully coupled experiments with climate models.</li><br><br></ol><br><br><ol style="margin-top:0in" start="3" type="1"><br><br>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><br><br>    <p class="default-style">Perform<br><br>    a detailed analysis and forward simulation of the Santarém mesoscale<br><br>    campaign of July-August 2001 using SiB3/RAMS5.

We will<br><br>    focus on the diurnal cycle of sensible and latent heat fluxes and CO2 flux<br><br>    at the three towers, diurnal development of  the planetary boundary<br><br>    layer, its interaction with the regional trade wind circulation, and on<br><br>    mesoscale circulations in the presence of topography and rivers. We will<br><br>    also compare the time-varying vertical structure of CO2 in and just above<br><br>    PBL, and river-land contrasts of mid-morning CO2 on the two days during<br><br>    which we collected these data.</li><br><br></ol><br><br><ol style="margin-top:0in" start="4" type="1"><br><br>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><br><br>    <p class="default-style">Participate<br><br>    in a major campaign to be organized in the Tapajos region in 2003 or 2004 to<br><br>    investigate the Richey et al hypothesis of major fluxes of CO2 by evasion<br><br>    from inundated lands and open waters. We will provide modeling support using<br><br>    SiB3 and RAMS to simulate “background” fluxes from terre firme forests<br><br>    and pastures, and will also specify evasion fluxes from input obtained from<br><br>    collaborators. Our simulations will be used to interpret airborne and<br><br>    surface-based continuous measurements of CO2 and other tracers.
